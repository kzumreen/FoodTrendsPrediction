RECIPE🍝🍝🍝
For two hungry people:
-500g cherry tomatoes
-200g feta cheese
-around 5 table spoons olive oil (maybe more)
-pinch of salt and pepper
-1 teaspoon oregano
-garlic
-basil
-3/4 pack of pasta
-2 scoops of pasta water

Put tomatoes and feta into the baking tray, drizzle with olive oil (don't be shy with it), add salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic.
Bake in preheated oven on 200-250C around 20min.
In the meantime - cook the pasta.
Take the tray out of the oven- when the feta is golden brown. Mash all together in the tray. Add fresh basil.
If needed- add 2 scoops of pasta water.
Pasta in the mash. 🍝 And you're done 🤌
Ps.:
•Be careful with the salt- because feta is already salty 🧂
•If you want to spice it up - add couple chilli flakes 🌶
•If you don't like basil - substitute it with parsley 🌱
•If you don't like any herbs- you might be on the wrong profile 😅

8imL6UQFyN8,A smol version of the viral feta pasta,"Serving Size: 1 hamster

I’m sure you’ve seen a bunch of these already so I won’t explain the basics of the recipe but I added a few extra things:
- Mini penne for all things smol
- I used black garlic to add some sweetness to balance out the feta
- Added some spices like dried herbs, turmeric, and lots of red chili flakes

Overall really enjoyed it and I think the black garlic really helped balance the whole thing out! Original creator of this food trend was @liemessa

NB4Le5YnDL4,Baked Feta Pasta Mac + Cheese Hack!,"I may be biased but I love them. The road to perfection may be a little longer, but it’ll be worth it in the end, and in the meantime, the end results have been delicious regardless. So get out there, break barriers or whatever they say. Greatness may be on the other side. ✨

Feta Mac Hack

1lb small pasta of choice 
5 cups milk 
1 C parm reg
Drizzle of EVOO
Salt + Pep

Add feta to center of a large baking dish, then add dry pasta, milk, parm, s+p around the outside. Love the noods around a bit, then top feta with EVOO. This time I baked at 375 F for ~ 40 min. Tried at 400 and the feta was great but milk really curdled. At 375 it’s not as creamy right out the gate but finishes melting in when you stir it up. Halfway through cooking stir the noodles around to prevent them congealing you the sides of the dish. When it’s done, take it out and stir until we’ll combined and the cheese is all melty and everything is creamy and happy.

Vxc7PWCvba8,Baked Feta Pasta Video  - TikTok Feta Pasta - Uunifetapasta Recipe,"When my kids told me about the viral TikTok Baked Feta Pasta recipe, I had to put my own spin on it. Truth be told, this Uunifetapasta is an amazingly delicious recipe! And by using fresh ingredients throughout, you can't go wrong with this recipe for baked feta pasta!  Note: For a baked feta pasta cheese substitute you can use Cotjia cheese here in Southern California.

Here's what you'll need to make the recipe! Feel free to add your favorite ingredients, whether it's cooked shrimp, or a baked feta pasta with chicken! Just cook ahead and stir in at the end! I think Kalamata olives would go really well in this recipe too!

#bakedfetapasta #bakedfetapastatiktok #Uunifetapasta

1/2 pound pasta of your choice, cooked and drained
8 oz. feta cheese, block or crumbled
3-4 tablespoons chive oil or olive oil
3 cups grape or cherry tomatoes
8 cloves garlic, sliced
1/4 cup chopped oregano leaves
1 cup chopped baby spinach leaves
2-3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper to your taste

Place the cherry tomatoes in a 9x13 casserole dish. Add cherry tomatoes and drizzle with olive oil or chive oil. Place block of feta cheese in the middle, or feel free to use crumbled feta cheese instead. Add garlic slices, oregano, pepper flakes, salt and pepper.

Bake at 350 F for 30-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and wrinkled.

Remove from oven. Add drained hot pasta, baby spinach leaves, basil leaves and toss until well combined. Enjoy hot with toasted garlic bread!

Der Feta Pasta Trend ist zwar schon ein Jahr alt, aber besser spät als nie, oder? 😄 Hier ist Episode 5 meiner herbstlichen Keto-Rezepte. Diese Kreation mit Cherrytomaten, Chili, Knoblauch und Feta ist ein wahrer Gaumenschmaus.

Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
250 g Cherrytomaten
1 Chili
4 Knoblauchzehen
300 g Feta
Insgesamt 70 ml Olivenöl
4 Ringe Spaghetti Kürbis (ca. 400 g)
500 g Zucchini
Salz, Pfeffer nach Belieben

Nährwerte pro Portion 👉 398 kcal / Fett 33 g / Netto-KH 6 g / Eiweiß 17 g / Ballaststoffe 3 g

🔥 So geht's:
Cherrytomaten, Chili, Knoblauch und Feta in eine Auflaufform geben, großzügig Olivenöl, Salz und Pfeffer drübergeben.
Schneide 4 Ringe aus einem Spaghettikürbis, entferne die Kerne.
Lege ein Backpapier auf ein Ofenrost und stelle die Auflaufform darauf. Platziere die Kürbisringe daneben, beträufle sie mit Olivenöl und würze sie mit Salz.
Ab in den auf 180 Grad vorgeheizten Ofen (Heißluft oder Umluft) für 30 Minuten.
In der Zwischenzeit bereite mit einem Spiralschäler Zucchininudeln vor.
Hol die Auflaufform aus dem Ofen. Ich verspreche dir, der Duft ist einfach göttlich! Wende den Kürbis, gib die Zucchininudeln dazu und backe alles weitere 8 Minuten.
Zerkleinere den Spaghettikürbis und entferne die Schale. Verteile die Zucchininudeln darüber und gieße die köstliche Fetacreme darüber.
Optional: Noch etwas Pfeffer drüber und genieße deine leckere ""Keto Feta Spaghetti Kreation""! Guten Appetit! 😋🍽️

94a9S9-x1A4,BOURSIN CHEESE & SHRIMP PASTA | Feta Pasta with a TWIST | Better than Trending Feta Pasta | Boursin,"#boursin&shrimppasta
#fetapastawithatwist
#trendingfetapasta


So after trying the trending Feta Pasta in one of my previous videos, (which I was impressed to how good it turned out) I decided to give this a shot. 
I must say that this recipe was inspired by that Feta Pasta you see all over tiktok, I change things up a little bit and I came up with this amazing recipe. So Yes, Thank you Tiktok and thank you to whoever came up with the Feta Pasta Recipe, kudos to you, I now have a new addition to my list of pasta recipes , my FAVORITE addition actually :) Give it a try, you’ll love it! Saves you from grating a heaps of parmesan cheese and absolutely will save you a few bucks too as Boursin cheese is a lot  cheaper than parmesan or feta cheese. (Well at least in Toronto, I’m not sure about the price in your location ☺️)

I wanted to try the Boursin Garlic Flavor but unfortunately , the grocery ran out of it. So I picked the Shallots and Chives flavor instead. It was sooo good that I have been making this recipe already once or twice a week. Everyone’s favorite! Better than the Feta Pasta , no kidding! 
The Feta Cheese tends to dries out as the pasta cools down. The Boursin Cheese does not disappoint, the pasta with the sauce is still perfect the next day. 
I have also made batches of this already for meal prep, good to bring for lunches at work. You gotta bring more though, because your colleague might want to try it or have it all 😁
Go ahead and make this, highly recommended..it is sooo gooood don’t forget to share! Cheers! Enjoy your pasta!

Prep Time : 5 minutes 
Cooking time 35 minutes
Serves 2-3 people

What is Boursin Cheese?

salt, to taste

Add the spinach and cook until wilted. Season with salt, pepper, and dried dill.
Cook the Pasta:
5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

6. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water, then drain the rest.

Make it extra creamy by adding a splash of heavy cream or Greek yogurt.
Want more protein? Toss in grilled chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas.
Love spice? Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat.Music Used:

(I switched up the measurements to match the flavor to my liking - extra flavor always pls! These measurements feed 3-4 people!):
🍅1/2 lb pasta (I used bow tie but anything works) 
🍅1/4 cup olive oil 
🍅2 cups cherry tomatoes 
🍅5 thinly sliced garlic cloves 
🍅Salt & fresh black pepper to taste. Be careful with the amount of salt because Feta is already VERY salty!
🍅1 block of feta, about 8 Oz 
🍅Red chili flakes to taste 
🍅1 handful fresh basil 
🍅some optional additions I imagine would taste great are sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, etc! Have fun with it!

1. In a baking dish, add the olive oil, cherry tomatoes, garlic, salt & pepper. Mix it all together then place the block of feta in the center and top that with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a light drizzle of olive oil.
2. Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes on the middle rack. Then move the dish to the top rack and broil for about 10 minutes or until everything has a nice char on it. The more char the better - it brings in an incredible flavor! 
3. Remove from the oven then add in fresh basil and mix it all together. Fold in some cooked pasta and that is ALL!

hHC8vCai2U4,Tomaten-Feta-Pasta aus dem Ofen #rezept #pasta #pastalover,"🍅 Feta-Tomaten-Pasta aus dem Ofen. Das war vor einziger Zeit voll im Trend. Und weil es so gut funktioniert, findet es auch heute noch neue Liebhaber. 🍝

Hier ist mein Rezept für 4 Personen:

2 Knoblauchzehen, kleingewürfelt
300 g Vollkorn-Spaghetti
450 g Cherrytomaten
300 g Feta
jeweils 1 EL getrockneter Basilikum, Oregano, Rosmarin, Thymian
300 ml Wasser
ca. 5 EL Olivenöl
Pfeffer aus der Mühle

Zubereitung:

Den Backofen auf 200 Ober-Unterhitze vorheizen. Die Spaghetti in die Auflaufform geben. Die Cherrytomaten waschen und ebenfalls hineingeben. Mittig etwas Platz schaffen und den Feta hineinsetzen.

Die gewürfelten Knoblauchzehen und die Kräuter über die Tomaten streuen und alles mit Pfeffer würzen. Ca. 5 Esslöffel Olivenöl über die gesamte Auflaufform verteilen.

Mit 300 ml Wasser aufgießen, so dass die Spaghetti gut bedeckt sind. Die Auflaufform nun in den Backofen schieben und die Feta-Pasta 35 Minuten garen lassen. Nach der Hälfte der Garzeit einen Blick auf die Spaghetti werfen und ggf. mit 50 ml Wasser aufgießen, so dass sie nicht braun werden.

Sobald die Zeit abgelaufen ist, die Auflaufform herausnehmen und alles mit einer Gabel verrühren.

Ganz nach Geschmack, kann die Pasta noch mit einem Schuss Sahne oder geriebenem Parmesan verfeinert werden.

kf0O1ChMyww,"VIRAL BAKED FETA PASTA IS STILL AMAZING! easy to make, family friendly and a favorite!","HOLY shit this recipe still slaps! If you haven’t ever tried the OG viral baked feta pasta (literally from 2 years ago). You must. We made it this past week with a variety of veggies. It’s so good! Miles loved it too. Details below 🍝

Viral Baked Feta Pasta serves 2-4 (original by @feelgoodfooodie) 

1 pint Cherry Tomatoes 
2 Bell Peppers, chopped 
1 Zucchini, chopped 
Olive oil 
Salt & Pepper 
Dried Basil Spice / or Italian seasoning 
1/2 tsp minced Garlic 
8 oz Block of feta 
1/2 Box Rigatoni (1/2 lb) 
Reserved pasta water 
Fresh basil (optional for topping)

Wash, cut and prepare vegetables. Preheat oven to 400. 

In a baking dish (9x13), add tomatoes, peppers and zucchini. Drizzle generously with olive oil and season to taste with salt, pepper and dried basil or Italian seasoning. 

Add fresh block of feta directly in the middle of the vegetables. Make sure it’s flush with the dish. Add a drizzle more olive oil and seasoning on top of the feta. Spread the garlic on top of the feta. 

Bake on 400 for 35 minutes. Vegetables should be fully cooked and sizzling. You can leave in for another 5 minutes if needed. 

In this time, cook pasta of your choice. Make sure to keep some pasta water. 

When vegetables are cooked, remove from the oven and immediately press down on the feta and mix everything together. Add pasta and a splash of pasta water. Mix well until the creamy feta, vegetables and pasta are all throughly mixed together. 

Serve with fresh basil or more dried basil and enjoy!

1CKh71NKKUg,BAKED FETA PASTA 🍝 #easyrecipes,"BAKED FETA PASTA 🍅🧀 | I Primi del Lunedì

La pasta con feta e pomodoro l’ho sempre mangiata… ma mai così, infornata insieme ai pomodorini! 😍
E adesso ho capito perché questa versione ha fatto impazzire tutti: con pochissimi ingredienti ottieni un piatto cremoso, saporito e buonissimo 🤌

Per una porzione:
 • 80-100 g di pasta
 • Una dozzina di pomodorini (per me i piccadilly, tagliati a metà)
 • 100 g di feta
 • 1 spicchio d’aglio (facoltativo, io lo mangio 😋)
 • Olio extravergine d’oliva
 • Basilico fresco (o erbe aromatiche a piacere)

Metto la feta al centro della teglia, pomodorini intorno, aglio, olio… e via: in friggitrice ad aria a 200°C per 15 minuti.
Poi schiaccio, mescolo, aggiungo la pasta cotta e il basilico. Ed ecco la nostra BAKED FETA PASTA dei Primi del Lunedì ❤️

Trying hard here to not default to cheesy goodness in every recipe. This one is great for lunches or dinner. Of course you can add some chicken or shrimp if you like to round things out. But that would be 6 ingredients and I don’t want to get in trouble over here. Lol. 

1 cup quinoa, rinsed, add to pot with 1 3/4 cups water, bring to boil, turn down and cook, covered 15 min. 
2 cups chopped greens (rapini, spinach etc) add to quinoa after it cooks for 15 min. Stir greens in, cook covered for another 5 min. Turn off heat and let quinoa and greens sit for 5. 
150g enoki (or any other mushroom) - sauté in pan with oil
3 Tbsp chili crisp + 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar (mix together. 
Assemble - quinoa and greens, top with mushrooms and drizzle with chili crisp and vinegar.

3oq3gYZFgdM,🧀 Baked Feta Zucchini Pasta 🍝 #lowcarbrecipes #prediabetes #sugarfree,"🧀 Baked Feta Zucchini Pasta 🍝

A low-carb, creamy, and flavorful pasta dish made with spiralized zucchini and a simple baked feta and tomato sauce.

INGREDIENTS:
1 block of feta cheese
1 box of cherry tomatoes
3 large zucchini, spiralized
1/2 cup cooked chicken breast, chopped
1/4 cup spinach, chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup avocado oil
4 large garlic cloves
1/4 tsp oregano
Salt and black pepper to taste
Fresh parsley, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. In a baking dish, place the block of feta in the center. Surround it with the cherry tomatoes and garlic cloves.

3. Drizzle everything with avocado oil and season with oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the tomatoes have burst and the feta is soft and golden.

4. While the feta is baking, prepare your zucchini noodles. Once done, remove the dish from the oven. Use a fork to mash the feta, roasted garlic, and tomatoes together to create a creamy sauce.

5. Stir in the heavy cream, chopped spinach (it will wilt from the heat), and the cooked chicken breast. Add the raw zucchini noodles to the dish and toss everything together until the “pasta” is well-coated in the sauce.

6. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.",,2025-09-09T18:10:13Z,13148,568,8,PT52S,2025-10-15T16:43:44.836446

Today I will be showing you how I made the viral feta pasta (a little better) with the addition of not only feta cheese, but also ricotta cheese, and finished with parmigiano reggiano... cheese! 3 CHEESES in one creamy pasta dish. I just had to try this viral feta trend, and it was very easy to do. I loved the creamy texture the added cheeses gave this dish, so I highly recommend giving this easy recipe a try!

6Fj1UQEDZ24,Baked Feta Pasta - perfect summer meal 😍 recipe in the comments #recipe #shorts,"Was that too much olive oil? 😅

In 2021 we were throwing feta into the oven with cherry tomatoes. I feel like it’s time for a summer update:

Creamy feta is baked to perfection on zucchini, squash and a LOT of olive oil.

This is a hands-off meal that is great for when you don’t feel like cooking. Throw it all together and enjoy! 

Ingredients:
- Feta
- Squash/Zucchine 
- Red onion
- Garlic
- Thyme
- Olive oil/salt/pepper
- Red chili flakes
- Short tubular pasta (such as Mezze rigatoni)
- Lemon

Directions:

1️⃣ Preheat the oven to 425F. Chop the vegetables into larger bite sized pieces. You don’t want to cut them too small so they retain their structure. 

2️⃣ Add them to a large oven safe dish. Season with olive oil, salt, pepper, a pinch of thyme, red chili flakes. Mix well.

3️⃣ Place the feta blocks onto the vegetables. Season. Add a whole head of garlic with the tops cut off. 

4️⃣ Place the dish into the oven and bake for about 35 minutes or until the feta is browned. 
Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil, and cook the pasta according to the package instructions. I recommend going 2 minutes under the “al dente” recommendation. Reserve some pasta water.

5️⃣ Take the baking tray out of the oven and mix everything with the pasta. Add the zest and juice of one lemon. If you need to loosen up the sauce, add some of the reserved pasta water.

6️⃣ Garnish with chopped parsley and a little Parmesan cheese. Enjoy! 

Save this recipe and let me know what you think!

Hier ist ein Rezept für eine blitzschnelle Nudelsauce aus dem Airfryer.

🗒️ 𝐙𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐠:
✔️ (1) Für die Nudelsauce gebe ich einfach die Kirschtomaten mit dem Grün in eine Airfryer-Form. 
Dazu kommt ein Block Feta-Käse. 
✔️ (2) Dazu gebe ich zwei Knoblauchzehen mit Schale in die Form, entferne aber die grossen Enden. 
Zusätliches Aroma bekommt man durch einen EL getrockenter Oregano. Dazu kommen zwei EL Olivenöl. 
✔️ (3) Wenn man Schärfe mag kann man ebenfalls 1 TL Chiliflocken dazu geben.
✔️ (4) Die Form kommt jetzt für etwa 15 Minuten in der vorgeheitzten Heissluftfritteusse bei 180 C bis die Tomaten zerplatzen und der Knoblauch so weich ist, dass wir ihn aus der Haut drücken können. 
✔️ (5) Während die Sauce in der Heissluftfritteusse gar wird, kochen wir die Nudeln laut der Packungsanweisung.
✔️ (6) Dann werfe ich einen Blick auf die Tomaten. Es riecht wunderbar. Die Tomaten werden im Airfryer weich und süß und geben viel Saft ab. Ich gebe alles in einer Servierschale.
✔️ (7) Den Knoblauchen drücken wir mit den Fingern aus der Schale und zerdrücken sie mit einer Gabel.
✔️ (8) Dann entferne ich das Grün der Tomaten und zerdrücke sie mit einer Gabel, so entsteht eine leckere Sauce direkt in der Form. 
✔️ (9) Den Käse zerdrücke ich ebenfalls und mische dann alles gut durch. 
✔️ (10) Die Nudeln kommen zu der Tomatensauce, alles gut vermischen und mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken. 
✔️ (11) Dazu kommt frischer Basilikum und fertig  ist das rustikale hausgemachtes leckere Nudelgericht in 20 Minuten.

I'm a big fan of this dish & the flavors complement each other so well. Most importantly, you only need five main ingredients & it's (almost) a 1 pan meal. Let's cook!

* 4 cups cherry or grape tomatoes
* 8 oz asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil , plus 1 Tbsp to drizzle over cheese
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 8 oz block Feta Cheese
* 10 oz penne pasta
* 4 garlic cloves, finely minced, divided
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, or basil, finely minced

* Preheat oven to 400˚F. Add tomatoes and asparagus to a 9x13 casserole. Add 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt. Toss to combine. Make a space in the center and place your 8 oz block of feta in the pan. Drizzle the top with 1 Tbsp olive oil and another sprinkle of black pepper. Bake at 400 for 30 minutes until tomatoes start to burst.
* About halfway through your baking time, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add pasta. Cook according to package instructions, stirring a few times to keep the pasta from sticking. Drain pasta (reserving some cooking water if you decide to add it later).
* After 30 minutes, the tomatoes should burst and start to release their juice. Remove from the oven and immediately stir in remaining minced garlic and parsley and toss to combine. Use the back of a large spoon to press the cheese into the olive oil and stir until cheese is well dispersed in the dish.
* Stir in drained cooked pasta. Add reserved pasta water if desired. Serve warm. Be mindful of those tomatoes (the juicy centers can be very hot if you eat them right away). Add reserved hot pasta water as desired for saucier pasta.

You can leave this recipe as-is for a vegan version, or you can add chicken sausage for a complete dinner with added protein.

This recipe is adapted from the original recipe by Jenni at Liemessä blog and  made popular in America by MacKenzie at Grilled Cheese Social and Yumna at Feel Good Foodie.

You can get the printable recipe on our website at TheFitCookie.com

I tested this recipe with 3 different kinds of dairy free feta cheese: Violife, Daiya, and Good Planet. The best one for this recipe is the Daiya feta cheese! I love Violife but it melts too much when cooked.

What was I thinking?

It is okay though— I learned from it, and I grew from it. If not for me taking those first steps, I would not be where I am today. Every person starts somewhere, and those “cringe” beginnings are proof that you are moving forward.

dqxZBTqxU9g,Vegan Baked Feta Pasta - Viral Recipe,"BAKED FETA PASTA, VEGANIZED!
.
🤯I don't want brag but this recipe might be the best vegan pasta dish I've ever had. I literally shed a tear at my first bite. Creamy, dreamy, packed with protein, 100% plant-based and I would bet any omnivore would NEVER be able to tell this is cheeseless. Here's the breakdown.
.
1 block extra firm tofu (not pressed)
1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight or boiled for 30 minutes
1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt & pepper
Big handful of spinach2 cups cooked pasta of choice
.
✅Preheat the oven to 400F.
.
💪🏻Place your tofu, cashew, salt, nutritional yeast, garlic powder and apple cider vinegar in the blender. Combine until a smooth paste is formed.
.
👍Place the cherry tomatoes in a deep baking dish, and drizzle with olive oil. Pour the tofu ""feta"" in the middle, and top with more salt and pepper. Pop in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the tomatoes have bursted.
.
👏Stir with a spoon until the tomatoes and ""feta"" meld together, and add a handful of spinach into the mix. Pour in your pasta, and mix until coated with the sauce. Enjoy
.
👍What should I veganize next?💕

mHcNSVtNhQ4,Viral Feta Pasta VEGAN STYLE,"Took a while but I finally tried the vegan version of the viral feta pasta 😂 have you tried it yet?

Subscribe to @ratedvfood for more vegan food and travel 

Ingredients
2 pints (17 1/2 ounces / 500 grams) cherry or grape tomatoes
6 cloves garlic, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Kosher salt
1 block (7 ounces / 200 grams) @traderjoes vegan feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
12 ounces medium-length dried pasta

Directions 
In a small baking tray add cherry tomatoes, garlic cloves, salt, olive oil and feta in the middle 

Bake at 375F for 40 min or the highest heat in a toaster oven 

Mash the feta and tomatoes with a fork and mix until evenly combined. Mix the sauce with pasta, adding the reserved pasta water as needed if it looks a little dry. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. To serve, divide among bowls and top with plenty of basil leaves. Adjust as needed I liked adding a bit of tomato paste or if in a a tiny bit of ketchup works too 😉

wsuD-P5yk_o,trying the viral TikTok feta pasta |  *As someone who sucks at cooking lol*,"I tried the viral TikTok Feta pasta while in NYC because we had no groceries. The recipe is included below! This turned out surprisingly well considering my cooking skills are subpar lol. 

My main channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnPZgiDoCr0BZqo-pWwYbwA

Recipe:
8 -16 ounces dry pasta pasta (I used about 12, which was 3/4 of the 16 oz box)
2 pints cherry tomatoes
7- ounce block feta cheese
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
¼ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1.5 tbsp minced garlic
Chopped basil

Preheat Oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Add tomatoes, oil, and garlic to an oven safe baking dish. Stir so tomatoes are coated in the oil/garlic mix. Place the feta block in the center of the dish. Add salt and pepper, then bake for 35 minutes. While baking, boil pasta until tender. Remove dish from oven and mix so the tomato mixture is coated with the feta. Add the pasta to the dish and mix again until pasta is coated in the baked mix. Lastly, add the chopped basil and mix a final time. Done!

dqxZBTqxU9g,Vegan Baked Feta Pasta - Viral Recipe,"BAKED FETA PASTA, VEGANIZED!
.
🤯I don't want brag but this recipe might be the best vegan pasta dish I've ever had. I literally shed a tear at my first bite. Creamy, dreamy, packed with protein, 100% plant-based and I would bet any omnivore would NEVER be able to tell this is cheeseless. Here's the breakdown.
.
1 block extra firm tofu (not pressed)
1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight or boiled for 30 minutes
1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt & pepper
Big handful of spinach2 cups cooked pasta of choice
.
✅Preheat the oven to 400F.
.
💪🏻Place your tofu, cashew, salt, nutritional yeast, garlic powder and apple cider vinegar in the blender. Combine until a smooth paste is formed.
.
👍Place the cherry tomatoes in a deep baking dish, and drizzle with olive oil. Pour the tofu ""feta"" in the middle, and top with more salt and pepper. Pop in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the tomatoes have bursted.
.
👏Stir with a spoon until the tomatoes and ""feta"" meld together, and add a handful of spinach into the mix. Pour in your pasta, and mix until coated with the sauce. Enjoy
.
👍What should I veganize next?💕

qpiJiZBQbT4,Baked Feta Pasta Recipe ( TikTok Pasta ) 😋🖤 #shorts #tiktokpasta #fetapasta,"Hi!

In this video, I show you how to make baked feta pasta , aka the TikTok pasta :)) This is a super easy pasta recipe, and you really don't need to know how to cook well to do this. I've seen a lot of different variations of this pasta on my YouTube Shorts feed, and I decided to make my own. What is different with this recipe is that I actually blend the baked feta, tomato and garlic to make a sauce. I don't think this is for everyone as it kind of softens the pasta, but I really enjoy it!

Let me know if you want more cooking videos from me :) I've really been enjoying making more homemade food lately, and I really like to make these chill ""how to"" videos. 

I think it's more trending with shorter, fast paced videos - but I also really enjoy to make this kind of content :)

hwLhmdN9f0c,Who else is still making the feta pasta in 2023?,"This viral pasta recipe has a chokehold on me since it first trended on TikTok in 2021. It’s now one of my staple meals that is quick and easy to make! 

Recipe:
Pasta of choice - cook based on box instructions 
crumbled feta
1 tbsp minced garlic 
Olive oil - measure with love
Basil (or other preferred herbs, I used parsley in this one)
Spinach (or other preferred leafy greens) 
Cherry tomatoes - about a dozen cut in half

Place all ingredients (aside from pasta) in an oven safe dish and bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Add spinach only in the last five minutes in the oven.

Add cooked pasta and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Top with Parmesan cheese optional.

5-7 tbsps extra virgin oil
sea salt
1 tsp black pepper
optiona: chili flakes

Steps:
1. get the cherry tomatoes in a pyrex or oven safe cooking tray.
2. sprinkle evoo, salt, and black pepper and mix.
3. get the cheese in the centre, sprinkle a bit more evoo and the chili flakes. mix on the feta block.
4. get in the oven on 450ºF for 30 minutes or until the tomatoes and top of the cheese are browned.

Pasta:
1. get pot of water on high heat and add salt. Mix it and put cover back on.
2. Once reaches a rapid boil add in your pasta and stir. Follow the times on the packaging and aim for al dente.
3. Taste, and when ready, turn the heat off, strain the pasta (keep 1 cup of the pasta water). Rinse with a little bit of cool water.
4. Add them back to the pot, put the cover back on and leave it on the side.

Continuation:
5. when the feta and tomatoes are done, take them out and add in your garlic and basil right away.
6. with a spoon, break the cheese and mix it well into the tomatoes. Pop the tomatoes if they aren't already.
7. Add in your pasta and continue to mix well in order to make sure every pasta is covered with cheesy tomato goodness.

PRO TIP: if it is too dry or thick, add in some of the pasta water. This will loosen it up and leave a great sauce throughout.

eOsTAAeX6rU,Zucchini Feta pasta,"Zucchini Feta Pasta

I felt healthy eating this, it might be not, but really so tasty, its a great quick dinner. 
Recipe 
1 zucchini 
200g feta cheese
1/2 green bell pepper
1 medium onion
3 cloves garlic
Olive oil
Salt n pepper
Red chilli flakes
Pasta of ur choice 

Method
Start by chopping your veggies, and lining up on a sheet tray or baking tray, with block of feta in the middle. 

Drizzle generously with olive oil, pepper and red chilli flakes. When u put the salt be careful as feta is very salty. Roast in the oven for 40mins on 230c. 

Boil your heavily salted water for cooking pasta. I m using maccheroni, but use any chunky pasta. I cooked mine as per the instructions on packaging that was 7mins.

Finally when the veggies are roasted and feta is melty, assemble everything well. Sprinkle more red chilli flakes while eating.

rrbXkpDFUQY,✨KETO BAKED FETA PASTA✨ Details below 👇🏼,"The @kaizenfoodco #lowcarb cavatappi noodles make this viral sensation possible for even us carb counters to enjoy. I served this to my whole family and no one knew it wasn’t “real” pasta!

INGREDIENTS

-8 ounces cavatappi pasta or pasta of choice, I used @kaizen
-2 pints organic cherry tomatoes
-8 ounce block feta cheese
-½ cup extra virgin olive oil
-¼ teaspoon salt
-¼ teaspoon black pepper
-¼ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
-¼ teaspoon onion powder (optional)
-2 garlic cloves minced (I used 4)
-¼ cup packed chopped fresh basil
-parmesan & red pepper flakes for serving

INSTRUCTIONS

1) Preheat oven to 400°F. Place the cherry tomatoes in an oven-safe baking dish. Pour the olive oil on top, and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Toss until well combined.

2) Place the feta block in the middle of the baking dish surrounded by the cherry tomatoes, and flip a couple times to coat it with the olive oil and seasoning.

3) Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, until the cherry tomatoes burst, and the feta cheese melts.

4) While the tomatoes and feta are baking, cook the pasta in a pot of salted water according to package instructions until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup of the cooking liquid in case you’d like to toss it in.

5) Immediately add the garlic and basil leaves to the cooked tomatoes and feta and toss everything to combine.

6) Transfer the cooked pasta to the baking dish and toss to combine. Garnish with parmesan and red pepper flakes and serve warm. Enjoy!

_C9qiKRXics,Viral Baked Vegan / Vegetarian Feta Pasta Recipe l Tik Tok Viral Recipe  #shorts #viraltiktok #vegan,"Viral Baked Feta Pasta Recipe l Tik Tok Viral Recipe #shorts #viraltiktok #vegan

This viral baked feta pasta recipe is a simple recipe made by oven roasting a block of vegan feta cheese with cherry tomatoes to create a salty and cheesy sauce!

Viral Baked Feta Pasta Recipe ingredients: 
8 ounces pasta 
2 pints cherry tomatoes
8- ounce vegan block feta cheese
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
¼ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
2 garlic cloves minced 

Viral Baked Feta Pasta Recipe instructions: 

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

Place the cherry tomatoes around the pasta in the baking dish.

Place the feta cheese block in the center of the baking dish, nestled among the tomatoes.

In a small bowl, combine the extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic cloves, sea salt, and black pepper. Stir well to mix the ingredients.

Pour the olive oil mixture over the pasta, tomatoes, and feta cheese. Make sure to evenly distribute the mixture, coating the ingredients.

Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the tomatoes have burst, the feta cheese has softened, and the pasta is cooked to your desired tenderness. You can adjust the baking time based on your preference for softer or firmer pasta.

Once baked, remove the dish from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes.

Before serving, gently stir the baked pasta, tomatoes, and melted feta cheese together. The feta cheese should easily break apart and create a creamy sauce with the olive oil and tomatoes.

Serve the baked feta pasta warm as a main dish or as a side. You can garnish it with fresh herbs like basil or parsley if desired.

Enjoy your delicious baked feta pasta with cherry tomato

3Yf6WSRkGE8,Healthy #Viralpasta - Baked Feta Pasta recipe,"I am sure you have seen the #viralpasta videos going around Tik Tok and Instagram. Here is my healthy take on this with courgetti/zucchini noodles and spinach to make it nutritious and delicious.

Here is the recipe:
1 punnet cherry tomatoes
1 red pepper, sliced
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic, sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
1 block of feta of your choice ( I have used dairy free version)
2 courgettes/zucchinis shredded to long noodles 
1 big handful of spinach

Method:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius
In your baking dish mix together cherry tomatoes, peppers, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.
Place the feta in the middle and drizzle with touch more of olive oil and some extra seasoning.
Pop in the oven and bake for around 30 minutes or until the tomatoes are cooked (soft to touch) and the feta is slightly melting.
Once the feta is cooked, mash up all the tomatoes and feta with a fork.
Add in the courgette noodles and spinach and enjoy while still warm.

1. Prepare the Bake: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, add cherry tomatoes, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, fresh basil and oregano, and olive oil. Place the feta cheese block in the center and drizzle a little olive oil over it.
2. Bake: Bake uncovered for 30 minutes until the tomatoes burst and the feta turns soft and golden.
3. Cook the Pasta: While the feta bakes, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add salt, ghee, and pasta. Cook until al dente, then drain (reserve some pasta water, as needed).
4. Mix it Up: Remove the baking dish from the oven. Mash the softened feta and tomatoes with a fork until creamy. Mix in the cooked pasta, adding a splash of reserved pasta water for extra creaminess if needed.
5. Garnish & Serve: Top with fresh basil and oregano. Serve warm and enjoy!

200g of pasta (use less if you don't want leftovers)
200g of feta 
325g of baby plum tomatoes.
1 teaspoon of pepper.
1 teaspoon of mixed herbs.
2 tablespoons of light olive oil.
1 bulb of garlic. 
A few sprays of frylite.
Garlic salt, pepper and mixed herbs to taste for the chicken.

Dice chicken breast.

Cook pasta using packet instructions. When done keep some of the pasta water.

In an ovenproof dish add feta, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, pepper and mixed herbs. Cook on gas mark 6 for 20-25 minutes. 

Add frylite, chicken and seasonings. Once chicken is half done, add the spinach. Once fully cooked take the feta out of the oven.

Mash everything together and add to the chicken, along with some pasta water. Add pasta.

xQzElu-4WPU,Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta | Baked Feta Pasta TikTok Recipe | Cooking Up Love,"Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta is the Tik Tok feta pasta recipe everyone’s talking about and it's so easy and very delicious. Our version uses feta crumbles and if you’re like me, I don’t have a block of feta in the fridge but I do have feta crumbles, and with these, tomatoes and pasta, you’ll be serving up this super tasty dish in no time!

Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta Ingredients
3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
5 cloves garlic (optional)
salt & pepper to taste
1/2 tsp oregano
avocado or olive oil
1/2 lb pasta, cooked (about half a box)

Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta Directions
Begin preheating the oven to 400 degrees, and spread about a tablespoon of avocado or olive oil across a sheet pan. Next, slice 3 cups of cherry tomatoes in half. The original TikTok baked feta pasta recipe bakes the whole tomatoes until they burst, I'm using our favorite way to roast tomatoes, laying them cut side up on an oiled baking sheet. As they roast, the tomatoes will become rich, with a deep caramelized flavor and a little sweetness. I’m also tucking a few garlic cloves here to roast along with the tomatoes, which I’ll squeeze a bit into the pasta and use it to make garlic bread. Sprinkle with a few teaspoons of avocado or olive oil, then a little salt, pepper and oregano, I love oregano with roasted tomatoes, you could also use thyme or like the original TikTok feta tomato pasta recipe, basil.

Place into the 400 degree oven and bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan and remove the garlic. Bake for another 10 - 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and add 4 - 5 tablespoons of feta crumbles. Place the baking sheet back in the oven for 5 - 10 minutes.

While the tomatoes and feta finish roasting, prepare the pasta according to the directions on the box. Drain and shake off the pasta water, and add to a mixing bowl. Then just add the roasted tomatoes and feta… stir and serve! A delicious tomato feta pasta bake!

Tiktok baked feta pasta is my new favorite TikTok recipe :D it turned out pretty delicious! Have you discovered a new recipe on TikTok?! List it in the comments!
