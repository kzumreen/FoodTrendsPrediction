RECIPE: 
1.5 pounds cherry tomatoes
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 
1/4 teaspoon unrefined salt & fresh pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 block of feta cheese(8 ounces)
12 ounces pasta(I used brown rice spirals)

Preheat oven to 400F convection if you have, otherwise regular bake is fine. Add the tomatoes to a 9x13 baking dish along with the oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano. Mix well and place the feta in the middle(touching the bottom of the pan) and bake for 30 minutes. 

Boil pasta and keep warm in some reserved pasta water in the pot. After 30 minutes, use a potato masher or large spoon to mash the tomatoes with the feta, add pasta, mix well.

RECIPE🍝🍝🍝
For two hungry people:
-500g cherry tomatoes
-200g feta cheese
-around 5 table spoons olive oil (maybe more)
-pinch of salt and pepper
-1 teaspoon oregano
-garlic
-basil
-3/4 pack of pasta
-2 scoops of pasta water

Put tomatoes and feta into the baking tray, drizzle with olive oil (don't be shy with it), add salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic.
Bake in preheated oven on 200-250C around 20min.
In the meantime - cook the pasta.
Take the tray out of the oven- when the feta is golden brown. Mash all together in the tray. Add fresh basil.
If needed- add 2 scoops of pasta water.
Pasta in the mash. 🍝 And you're done 🤌
Ps.:
•Be careful with the salt- because feta is already salty 🧂
•If you want to spice it up - add couple chilli flakes 🌶
•If you don't like basil - substitute it with parsley 🌱
•If you don't like any herbs- you might be on the wrong profile 😅

1 block of feta cheese
8 oz cherry tomatoes
salt and pepper
olive oil
1 Tbsp chopped basil
2 cloves minced garlic
12 oz pasta of your choice (I used gluten free)

Preheat the oven to 400f

To a baking dish, add cherry tomatoes, olive oil and salt & pepper.  Mix to coat with the olive oil.  Then, add the block of feta cheese into the middle of the pan.  Drizzle olive oil onto the feta.  Add your basil and garlic.  Then bake for 25-30 minutes or until tomatoes are soft and fragrant.  

While feta is baking, cook your pasta to packaged directions in salted water.  Save some pasta water! 

Remove baking dish from the oven.  Mash tomatoes and feta together.  Then add pasta water to thin.  Once you have a sauce, add your pasta and mix together.  

To plate, add some feta pasta and garnish with basil.  Enjoy!",,2023-10-18 19:59:47+00:00,276824,23500,167,PT30S,2025-10-15 20:43:59.504400+00:00,feta pasta recipe,30.0,0.0854947547900471,728.0307002824075,Short,91
8imL6UQFyN8,A smol version of the viral feta pasta,"Serving Size: 1 hamster

I’m sure you’ve seen a bunch of these already so I won’t explain the basics of the recipe but I added a few extra things:
- Mini penne for all things smol
- I used black garlic to add some sweetness to balance out the feta
- Added some spices like dried herbs, turmeric, and lots of red chili flakes

Overall really enjoyed it and I think the black garlic really helped balance the whole thing out! Original creator of this food trend was @liemessa

NB4Le5YnDL4,Baked Feta Pasta Mac + Cheese Hack!,"I may be biased but I love them. The road to perfection may be a little longer, but it’ll be worth it in the end, and in the meantime, the end results have been delicious regardless. So get out there, break barriers or whatever they say. Greatness may be on the other side. ✨

Feta Mac Hack

1lb small pasta of choice 
5 cups milk 
1 C parm reg
Drizzle of EVOO
Salt + Pep

Add feta to center of a large baking dish, then add dry pasta, milk, parm, s+p around the outside. Love the noods around a bit, then top feta with EVOO. This time I baked at 375 F for ~ 40 min. Tried at 400 and the feta was great but milk really curdled. At 375 it’s not as creamy right out the gate but finishes melting in when you stir it up. Halfway through cooking stir the noodles around to prevent them congealing you the sides of the dish. When it’s done, take it out and stir until we’ll combined and the cheese is all melty and everything is creamy and happy.

Vxc7PWCvba8,Baked Feta Pasta Video  - TikTok Feta Pasta - Uunifetapasta Recipe,"When my kids told me about the viral TikTok Baked Feta Pasta recipe, I had to put my own spin on it. Truth be told, this Uunifetapasta is an amazingly delicious recipe! And by using fresh ingredients throughout, you can't go wrong with this recipe for baked feta pasta!  Note: For a baked feta pasta cheese substitute you can use Cotjia cheese here in Southern California.

Here's what you'll need to make the recipe! Feel free to add your favorite ingredients, whether it's cooked shrimp, or a baked feta pasta with chicken! Just cook ahead and stir in at the end! I think Kalamata olives would go really well in this recipe too!

#bakedfetapasta #bakedfetapastatiktok #Uunifetapasta

1/2 pound pasta of your choice, cooked and drained
8 oz. feta cheese, block or crumbled
3-4 tablespoons chive oil or olive oil
3 cups grape or cherry tomatoes
8 cloves garlic, sliced
1/4 cup chopped oregano leaves
1 cup chopped baby spinach leaves
2-3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper to your taste

Place the cherry tomatoes in a 9x13 casserole dish. Add cherry tomatoes and drizzle with olive oil or chive oil. Place block of feta cheese in the middle, or feel free to use crumbled feta cheese instead. Add garlic slices, oregano, pepper flakes, salt and pepper.

Bake at 350 F for 30-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and wrinkled.

Remove from oven. Add drained hot pasta, baby spinach leaves, basil leaves and toss until well combined. Enjoy hot with toasted garlic bread!

mN7z8_-xnjY,Feta Pasta TREND in KETO? 🤯 #shorts #ketodiät #ketogeneernährung #ketorezepte #ketoideen #fetapasta,"Keto Herbstrezepte: Episode 5 -  Keto Feta Pasta! 🍝🍁 Perfekt für deine Keto Diät und ketogene Ernährung.

Der Feta Pasta Trend ist zwar schon ein Jahr alt, aber besser spät als nie, oder? 😄 Hier ist Episode 5 meiner herbstlichen Keto-Rezepte. Diese Kreation mit Cherrytomaten, Chili, Knoblauch und Feta ist ein wahrer Gaumenschmaus.

Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
250 g Cherrytomaten
1 Chili
4 Knoblauchzehen
300 g Feta
Insgesamt 70 ml Olivenöl
4 Ringe Spaghetti Kürbis (ca. 400 g)
500 g Zucchini
Salz, Pfeffer nach Belieben

Nährwerte pro Portion 👉 398 kcal / Fett 33 g / Netto-KH 6 g / Eiweiß 17 g / Ballaststoffe 3 g

🔥 So geht's:
Cherrytomaten, Chili, Knoblauch und Feta in eine Auflaufform geben, großzügig Olivenöl, Salz und Pfeffer drübergeben.
Schneide 4 Ringe aus einem Spaghettikürbis, entferne die Kerne.
Lege ein Backpapier auf ein Ofenrost und stelle die Auflaufform darauf. Platziere die Kürbisringe daneben, beträufle sie mit Olivenöl und würze sie mit Salz.
Ab in den auf 180 Grad vorgeheizten Ofen (Heißluft oder Umluft) für 30 Minuten.
In der Zwischenzeit bereite mit einem Spiralschäler Zucchininudeln vor.
Hol die Auflaufform aus dem Ofen. Ich verspreche dir, der Duft ist einfach göttlich! Wende den Kürbis, gib die Zucchininudeln dazu und backe alles weitere 8 Minuten.
Zerkleinere den Spaghettikürbis und entferne die Schale. Verteile die Zucchininudeln darüber und gieße die köstliche Fetacreme darüber.
Optional: Noch etwas Pfeffer drüber und genieße deine leckere ""Keto Feta Spaghetti Kreation""! Guten Appetit! 😋🍽️

94a9S9-x1A4,BOURSIN CHEESE & SHRIMP PASTA | Feta Pasta with a TWIST | Better than Trending Feta Pasta | Boursin,"#boursin&shrimppasta
#fetapastawithatwist
#trendingfetapasta


So after trying the trending Feta Pasta in one of my previous videos, (which I was impressed to how good it turned out) I decided to give this a shot. 
I must say that this recipe was inspired by that Feta Pasta you see all over tiktok, I change things up a little bit and I came up with this amazing recipe. So Yes, Thank you Tiktok and thank you to whoever came up with the Feta Pasta Recipe, kudos to you, I now have a new addition to my list of pasta recipes , my FAVORITE addition actually :) Give it a try, you’ll love it! Saves you from grating a heaps of parmesan cheese and absolutely will save you a few bucks too as Boursin cheese is a lot  cheaper than parmesan or feta cheese. (Well at least in Toronto, I’m not sure about the price in your location ☺️)

I wanted to try the Boursin Garlic Flavor but unfortunately , the grocery ran out of it. So I picked the Shallots and Chives flavor instead. It was sooo good that I have been making this recipe already once or twice a week. Everyone’s favorite! Better than the Feta Pasta , no kidding! 
The Feta Cheese tends to dries out as the pasta cools down. The Boursin Cheese does not disappoint, the pasta with the sauce is still perfect the next day. 
I have also made batches of this already for meal prep, good to bring for lunches at work. You gotta bring more though, because your colleague might want to try it or have it all 😁
Go ahead and make this, highly recommended..it is sooo gooood don’t forget to share! Cheers! Enjoy your pasta!

Prep Time : 5 minutes 
Cooking time 35 minutes
Serves 2-3 people

What is Boursin Cheese?

1/2 pound mini pasta shells or fusilli pasta
salt, to taste
freshly cracked black pepper to taste

5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

6. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water, then drain the rest.

Make it extra creamy by adding a splash of heavy cream or Greek yogurt.
Want more protein? Toss in grilled chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas.
Love spice? Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat.Music Used:

(I switched up the measurements to match the flavor to my liking - extra flavor always pls! These measurements feed 3-4 people!):
🍅1/2 lb pasta (I used bow tie but anything works) 
🍅1/4 cup olive oil 
🍅2 cups cherry tomatoes 
🍅5 thinly sliced garlic cloves 
🍅Salt & fresh black pepper to taste. Be careful with the amount of salt because Feta is already VERY salty!
🍅1 block of feta, about 8 Oz 
🍅Red chili flakes to taste 
🍅1 handful fresh basil 
🍅some optional additions I imagine would taste great are sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, etc! Have fun with it!

1. In a baking dish, add the olive oil, cherry tomatoes, garlic, salt & pepper. Mix it all together then place the block of feta in the center and top that with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a light drizzle of olive oil.
2. Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes on the middle rack. Then move the dish to the top rack and broil for about 10 minutes or until everything has a nice char on it. The more char the better - it brings in an incredible flavor! 
3. Remove from the oven then add in fresh basil and mix it all together. Fold in some cooked pasta and that is ALL!

You know how when you eat pasta with a cream or Alfredo sauce, the sauce ends up taking center stage.  Feta does not over power the pasta, it compliments it perfectly. Giving you subtle creaminess but leaving plenty of room for all the other flavors to speak. Here’s the recipe👍

1 packet spaghetti 
1 block feta cheese (8 oz)
2 boxes cherry tomatoes (12 oz)
Olive oil @bonodisicilia8391  
Sea salt to taste
Cracked pepper to taste
1 lemon
Lemon pepper seasoning  
3 minced garlic cloves 
1/2 red onion chopped

Directions:
• preheat oven to 400 degrees and toss your cherry tomatoes in a bowl with olive oil, sea salt, pepper, some garlic, red onion, and 1/2 lemon juiced.
• place feta block on a parchment lined baking sheet with tomatoes and bake for 40 minutes
• Toss shrimp in the same bowl as your tomatoes with olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning, some garlic, red onion, and remaining lemon juice. Grill over high heat for 15 to 20 minutes or until internal temp of your shrimp reaches 120 degrees.
• Cook your noodles, drain, and add your baked tomatoes/feta, and your shrimp and toss together until pasta is evenly coated. Enjoy!

These beautiful tomatoes came from @rusticroadfarm2783  or the greatest place on earth 🌎. They are so fresh and delicious I could snack on them daily.  And remember…

kf0O1ChMyww,"VIRAL BAKED FETA PASTA IS STILL AMAZING! easy to make, family friendly and a favorite!","HOLY shit this recipe still slaps! If you haven’t ever tried the OG viral baked feta pasta (literally from 2 years ago). You must. We made it this past week with a variety of veggies. It’s so good! Miles loved it too. Details below 🍝

Viral Baked Feta Pasta serves 2-4 (original by @feelgoodfooodie) 

1 pint Cherry Tomatoes 
2 Bell Peppers, chopped 
1 Zucchini, chopped 
Olive oil 
Salt & Pepper 
Dried Basil Spice / or Italian seasoning 
1/2 tsp minced Garlic 
8 oz Block of feta 
1/2 Box Rigatoni (1/2 lb) 
Reserved pasta water 
Fresh basil (optional for topping)

Wash, cut and prepare vegetables. Preheat oven to 400. 

In a baking dish (9x13), add tomatoes, peppers and zucchini. Drizzle generously with olive oil and season to taste with salt, pepper and dried basil or Italian seasoning. 

Add fresh block of feta directly in the middle of the vegetables. Make sure it’s flush with the dish. Add a drizzle more olive oil and seasoning on top of the feta. Spread the garlic on top of the feta. 

Bake on 400 for 35 minutes. Vegetables should be fully cooked and sizzling. You can leave in for another 5 minutes if needed. 

In this time, cook pasta of your choice. Make sure to keep some pasta water. 

When vegetables are cooked, remove from the oven and immediately press down on the feta and mix everything together. Add pasta and a splash of pasta water. Mix well until the creamy feta, vegetables and pasta are all throughly mixed together. 

Serve with fresh basil or more dried basil and enjoy!

1CKh71NKKUg,BAKED FETA PASTA 🍝 #easyrecipes,"BAKED FETA PASTA 🍅🧀 | I Primi del Lunedì

La pasta con feta e pomodoro l’ho sempre mangiata… ma mai così, infornata insieme ai pomodorini! 😍
E adesso ho capito perché questa versione ha fatto impazzire tutti: con pochissimi ingredienti ottieni un piatto cremoso, saporito e buonissimo 🤌

Per una porzione:
 • 80-100 g di pasta
 • Una dozzina di pomodorini (per me i piccadilly, tagliati a metà)
 • 100 g di feta
 • 1 spicchio d’aglio (facoltativo, io lo mangio 😋)
 • Olio extravergine d’oliva
 • Basilico fresco (o erbe aromatiche a piacere)

Metto la feta al centro della teglia, pomodorini intorno, aglio, olio… e via: in friggitrice ad aria a 200°C per 15 minuti.
Poi schiaccio, mescolo, aggiungo la pasta cotta e il basilico. Ed ecco la nostra BAKED FETA PASTA dei Primi del Lunedì ❤️

1CKh71NKKUg,BAKED FETA PASTA 🍝 #easyrecipes,"BAKED FETA PASTA 🍅🧀 | I Primi del Lunedì

La pasta con feta e pomodoro l’ho sempre mangiata… ma mai così, infornata insieme ai pomodorini! 😍
E adesso ho capito perché questa versione ha fatto impazzire tutti: con pochissimi ingredienti ottieni un piatto cremoso, saporito e buonissimo 🤌

Per una porzione:
 • 80-100 g di pasta
 • Una dozzina di pomodorini (per me i piccadilly, tagliati a metà)
 • 100 g di feta
 • 1 spicchio d’aglio (facoltativo, io lo mangio 😋)
 • Olio extravergine d’oliva
 • Basilico fresco (o erbe aromatiche a piacere)

Metto la feta al centro della teglia, pomodorini intorno, aglio, olio… e via: in friggitrice ad aria a 200°C per 15 minuti.
Poi schiaccio, mescolo, aggiungo la pasta cotta e il basilico. Ed ecco la nostra BAKED FETA PASTA dei Primi del Lunedì ❤️

Trying hard here to not default to cheesy goodness in every recipe. This one is great for lunches or dinner. Of course you can add some chicken or shrimp if you like to round things out. But that would be 6 ingredients and I don’t want to get in trouble over here. Lol. 

1 cup quinoa, rinsed, add to pot with 1 3/4 cups water, bring to boil, turn down and cook, covered 15 min. 
2 cups chopped greens (rapini, spinach etc) add to quinoa after it cooks for 15 min. Stir greens in, cook covered for another 5 min. Turn off heat and let quinoa and greens sit for 5. 
150g enoki (or any other mushroom) - sauté in pan with oil
3 Tbsp chili crisp + 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar (mix together. 
Assemble - quinoa and greens, top with mushrooms and drizzle with chili crisp and vinegar.

3oq3gYZFgdM,🧀 Baked Feta Zucchini Pasta 🍝 #lowcarbrecipes #prediabetes #sugarfree,"🧀 Baked Feta Zucchini Pasta 🍝

A low-carb, creamy, and flavorful pasta dish made with spiralized zucchini and a simple baked feta and tomato sauce.

INGREDIENTS:
1 block of feta cheese
1 box of cherry tomatoes
3 large zucchini, spiralized
1/2 cup cooked chicken breast, chopped
1/4 cup spinach, chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup avocado oil
4 large garlic cloves
1/4 tsp oregano
Salt and black pepper to taste
Fresh parsley, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. In a baking dish, place the block of feta in the center. Surround it with the cherry tomatoes and garlic cloves.

3. Drizzle everything with avocado oil and season with oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the tomatoes have burst and the feta is soft and golden.

4. While the feta is baking, prepare your zucchini noodles. Once done, remove the dish from the oven. Use a fork to mash the feta, roasted garlic, and tomatoes together to create a creamy sauce.

5. Stir in the heavy cream, chopped spinach (it will wilt from the heat), and the cooked chicken breast. Add the raw zucchini noodles to the dish and toss everything together until the “pasta” is well-coated in the sauce.

6. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.",,2025-09-09 18:10:13+00:00,13157,568,9,PT52S,2025-10-15 20:44:00.814607+00:00,feta pasta recipe,52.0,0.043854982138785435,36.10680340980324,Short,69

x0e0fwf3zxA,Feta Pasta With A Twist (Ricotta) #Shorts,"Hi and welcome to my first #shorts video,

Today I will be showing you how I made the viral feta pasta (a little better) with the addition of not only feta cheese, but also ricotta cheese, and finished with parmigiano reggiano... cheese! 3 CHEESES in one creamy pasta dish. I just had to try this viral feta trend, and it was very easy to do. I loved the creamy texture the added cheeses gave this dish, so I highly recommend giving this easy recipe a try!

Thanks so much for watching, and if you enjoyed this video, please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more videos like this one :)

6Fj1UQEDZ24,Baked Feta Pasta - perfect summer meal 😍 recipe in the comments #recipe #shorts,"Was that too much olive oil? 😅

In 2021 we were throwing feta into the oven with cherry tomatoes. I feel like it’s time for a summer update:

Creamy feta is baked to perfection on zucchini, squash and a LOT of olive oil.

This is a hands-off meal that is great for when you don’t feel like cooking. Throw it all together and enjoy! 

Ingredients:
- Feta
- Squash/Zucchine 
- Red onion
- Garlic
- Thyme
- Olive oil/salt/pepper
- Red chili flakes
- Short tubular pasta (such as Mezze rigatoni)
- Lemon

Directions:

1️⃣ Preheat the oven to 425F. Chop the vegetables into larger bite sized pieces. You don’t want to cut them too small so they retain their structure. 

2️⃣ Add them to a large oven safe dish. Season with olive oil, salt, pepper, a pinch of thyme, red chili flakes. Mix well.

3️⃣ Place the feta blocks onto the vegetables. Season. Add a whole head of garlic with the tops cut off. 

4️⃣ Place the dish into the oven and bake for about 35 minutes or until the feta is browned. 
Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil, and cook the pasta according to the package instructions. I recommend going 2 minutes under the “al dente” recommendation. Reserve some pasta water.

5️⃣ Take the baking tray out of the oven and mix everything with the pasta. Add the zest and juice of one lemon. If you need to loosen up the sauce, add some of the reserved pasta water.

6️⃣ Garnish with chopped parsley and a little Parmesan cheese. Enjoy! 

Save this recipe and let me know what you think!

Hier ist ein Rezept für eine blitzschnelle Nudelsauce aus dem Airfryer.

🗒️ 𝐙𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐠:
✔️ (1) Für die Nudelsauce gebe ich einfach die Kirschtomaten mit dem Grün in eine Airfryer-Form. 
Dazu kommt ein Block Feta-Käse. 
✔️ (2) Dazu gebe ich zwei Knoblauchzehen mit Schale in die Form, entferne aber die grossen Enden. 
Zusätliches Aroma bekommt man durch einen EL getrockenter Oregano. Dazu kommen zwei EL Olivenöl. 
✔️ (3) Wenn man Schärfe mag kann man ebenfalls 1 TL Chiliflocken dazu geben.
✔️ (4) Die Form kommt jetzt für etwa 15 Minuten in der vorgeheitzten Heissluftfritteusse bei 180 C bis die Tomaten zerplatzen und der Knoblauch so weich ist, dass wir ihn aus der Haut drücken können. 
✔️ (5) Während die Sauce in der Heissluftfritteusse gar wird, kochen wir die Nudeln laut der Packungsanweisung.
✔️ (6) Dann werfe ich einen Blick auf die Tomaten. Es riecht wunderbar. Die Tomaten werden im Airfryer weich und süß und geben viel Saft ab. Ich gebe alles in einer Servierschale.
✔️ (7) Den Knoblauchen drücken wir mit den Fingern aus der Schale und zerdrücken sie mit einer Gabel.
✔️ (8) Dann entferne ich das Grün der Tomaten und zerdrücke sie mit einer Gabel, so entsteht eine leckere Sauce direkt in der Form. 
✔️ (9) Den Käse zerdrücke ich ebenfalls und mische dann alles gut durch. 
✔️ (10) Die Nudeln kommen zu der Tomatensauce, alles gut vermischen und mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken. 
✔️ (11) Dazu kommt frischer Basilikum und fertig  ist das rustikale hausgemachtes leckere Nudelgericht in 20 Minuten.

* 4 cups cherry or grape tomatoes
* 8 oz asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil , plus 1 Tbsp to drizzle over cheese
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 8 oz block Feta Cheese
* 10 oz penne pasta
* 4 garlic cloves, finely minced, divided
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, or basil, finely minced

* Preheat oven to 400˚F. Add tomatoes and asparagus to a 9x13 casserole. Add 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt. Toss to combine. Make a space in the center and place your 8 oz block of feta in the pan. Drizzle the top with 1 Tbsp olive oil and another sprinkle of black pepper. Bake at 400 for 30 minutes until tomatoes start to burst.
* About halfway through your baking time, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add pasta. Cook according to package instructions, stirring a few times to keep the pasta from sticking. Drain pasta (reserving some cooking water if you decide to add it later).
* After 30 minutes, the tomatoes should burst and start to release their juice. Remove from the oven and immediately stir in remaining minced garlic and parsley and toss to combine. Use the back of a large spoon to press the cheese into the olive oil and stir until cheese is well dispersed in the dish.
* Stir in drained cooked pasta. Add reserved pasta water if desired. Serve warm. Be mindful of those tomatoes (the juicy centers can be very hot if you eat them right away). Add reserved hot pasta water as desired for saucier pasta.

       Please turn on your language subtitles for description

Hello everybody
Today I made the sns hot recipe feta cheese pasta!
I made it simple using an oven! The taste is really fresh!
If you feel it's sour due to a lot of tomato and cheese, add 1 tablespoon of sugar and enjoy :)

안녕하세요 여러분
오늘은 틱톡에서 핫했던? 페타 치즈 파스타를 만들어 봤어요! 
오븐을 사용해서 간단하게 만들었는데요! 혹시 오븐이 없어 도전을 못하시는 분은!
팬에 파스타를 제외한 재료를 넣고 약불에서 뚜껑을 덮고 20분 익힌 후 소스를 만들어 주시면 됩니다!
이 파스타의 맛은 해외에서 사먹던 파스타 맛이 나요! 국내에서 먹는 파스타보다는 좀 신선하고 자극적이지 않아요!
토마토와 치즈가 많이 들어가서 시큼하다고 느껴진다면 설탕 1큰술을 넣어 즐겨주세요 :)

* Ingredients
Penne 100g, Feta Cheese 150g, Cherry Tomato 500g, Olive Oil, 3 Pepperoncino, 4 Garlics, 1 Teaspoon Chopped Garlic, Salt, Pepper, Basil
(I recommend using short pasta to make it!)

* 재료
펜네 100g, 페타 치즈 150g, 방울토마토 500g, 올리브 오일, 페퍼론치노 3개, 마늘 4개, 다진 마늘 1작은술, 소금, 후추, 바질
(숏파스타를 사용해서 만드는 것을 추천해요!)

* Recipe
1. In an oven-safe bowl or tray, add cherry tomatoes, 3Tbsp olive oil, and 4 garlic, mix, and add feta cheese.
2. Sprinkle pepperoncino and pepper on the feta cheese, and lightly coat with olive oil.
3. Bake the prepared sauce ingredients in an oven at 180 degrees for 30 minutes.
4. Boil the pasta while it is baking to prepare.
5. Add basil to the grilled pasta sauce according to your taste.
6. Add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic to the sauce and mix.
7. Add the boiled pasta to the sauce, mix it, and spread it on a plate to enjoy!

* 레시피
1. 오븐에 사용 가능한 그릇 혹은 트레이에 방울토마토, 올리브 오일 3큰술, 마늘 4개를 넣고 섞은 후 페타 치즈를 넣어주세요.
2. 페타 치즈 위에 페퍼론치노와 후추를 뿌린 후 올리브 오일을 살짝 둘러주세요.
3. 준비된 소스 재료를 오븐에 180도 30분동안 구워주세요.
4. 구워지는 동안 파스타를 삶아서 준비해 주세요.
5. 구워진 파스타 소스에 취향에 따라 바질을 더해주세요.
6. 소스에 다진 마늘 1작은술을 더해 섞어주세요.
7. 삶아진 파스타를 소스에 넣고 섞은 후 접시에 덜어 즐겨주세요!

MDY3b7xH4X0,VEGGIE PASTA FETA BAKE | @elliotts.kitchen,"VEGGIE PASTA FETA BAKE
Don’t hate me but when that feta tomato thing was going around a few years ago.. we never tried it. I wanted to see what the hype was about but also wanted to add some extra veggies to it. What I love about this meal is it’s so easy to put together - chop your veggies, place our feta, drizzle with olive oil, bake, add your pasta and go. So simple for weeknight meals. The flavor was great too. For some reason our tomatoes would not burst so the color of this when you make it should be more of a pink color but yeah, these tomatoes were not in the mood I guess. We also thought we had extra spinach to throw in at the end, but.. we didn’t so feel free to add that as well for some extra greens. Seb loves any pasta dish we throw in front of him. We paired it with some grilled chicken to add protein but you can make it without if you’d like. Great easy weeknight meal yet again! Tag me if you try it.

Everything we use is organic. If you need brand recs, comment or DM. I’ll hook you up. 

Ingredients: 
1 lb 1-ingredient pasta
6 oz feta block
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion sliced
1 large zucchini
1 orange bell pepper
Olive oil
Salt 
Pepper 
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Spinach (optional)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 400. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and corner your chopped veggies leaving room for the feta block in the middle. Add your oil, salt, pepper and toss veggies. Generously add oil, salt pepper, to feta block as well. Bake 15 mins. Add cooked pasta to a mixing bowl (save some pasta water) and stir the baked feta in. Add a little pasta water as needed to help mix it together. Add cooked veggies, lemon juice, more salt and pepper, and some spinach. Stir, serve and enjoy!

BAKED FETA PASTA

3 (10-ounce) containers cherry tomatoes (or grape tomatoes)
⅓ cup kalamata olives, halved
3 large cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon lemon zest
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
1 (8-ounce) block feta cheese
salt and pepper
16 ounces pasta (such as Cavatappi)
2 large lemon wedges
large handful fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine tomatoes, olives, garlic, oregano, zest, and red pepper flakes in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Reserve 2 tablespoons oil, then mix in the rest.

Add feta, then pour reserved oil over top. Bake until feta is soft and tomatoes are shriveled and starting to burst, about 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water before draining.

When sauce is finished cooking, add a small splash of pasta-cooking water. Mix feta and other ingredients together to form the sauce.
Squeeze lemon juice from wedges into pasta and add sliced basil. Mix well. Add pasta and stir, adding more pasta-cooking water, if needed. Season to taste.

You can leave this recipe as-is for a vegan version, or you can add chicken sausage for a complete dinner with added protein.

This recipe is adapted from the original recipe by Jenni at Liemessä blog and  made popular in America by MacKenzie at Grilled Cheese Social and Yumna at Feel Good Foodie.

You can get the printable recipe on our website at TheFitCookie.com

I tested this recipe with 3 different kinds of dairy free feta cheese: Violife, Daiya, and Good Planet. The best one for this recipe is the Daiya feta cheese! I love Violife but it melts too much when cooked.

sUctw4Jtg78,My Embarrassing Beginning Four Years Ago Making Baked Tomato Feta Pasta with Chicken & Green Beans,"This is so embarrassing. Four years ago today was part of my beginning creating content. I had no idea what I was doing (and still don’t… jokingly). But I had to start somewhere, and this terrible video was one of those places. At the time, each of these clips was an individual story. Then the actual post would be the final picture. What was I thinking?

It is okay though— I learned from it, and I grew from it. If not for me taking those first steps, I would not be where I am today. Every person starts somewhere, and those “cringe” beginnings are proof that you are moving forward.

Here is to the messy starts, the awkward first posts, and the courage to hit publish anyway.

Ingredients
2 pints (17 1/2 ounces / 500 grams) cherry or grape tomatoes
6 cloves garlic, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Kosher salt
1 block (7 ounces / 200 grams) @traderjoes vegan feta cheese
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
12 ounces medium-length dried pasta

Directions 
In a small baking tray add cherry tomatoes, garlic cloves, salt, olive oil and feta in the middle

Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. To serve, divide among bowls and top with plenty of basil leaves. Adjust as needed I liked adding a bit of tomato paste or if in a a tiny bit of ketchup works too 😉

My main channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnPZgiDoCr0BZqo-pWwYbwA

Recipe:
8 -16 ounces dry pasta pasta (I used about 12, which was 3/4 of the 16 oz box)
2 pints cherry tomatoes
7- ounce block feta cheese
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
¼ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1.5 tbsp minced garlic
Chopped basil

Preheat Oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Add tomatoes, oil, and garlic to an oven safe baking dish. Stir so tomatoes are coated in the oil/garlic mix. Place the feta block in the center of the dish. Add salt and pepper, then bake for 35 minutes. While baking, boil pasta until tender. Remove dish from oven and mix so the tomato mixture is coated with the feta. Add the pasta to the dish and mix again until pasta is coated in the baked mix. Lastly, add the chopped basil and mix a final time. Done!

dqxZBTqxU9g,Vegan Baked Feta Pasta - Viral Recipe,"BAKED FETA PASTA, VEGANIZED!
.
🤯I don't want brag but this recipe might be the best vegan pasta dish I've ever had. I literally shed a tear at my first bite. Creamy, dreamy, packed with protein, 100% plant-based and I would bet any omnivore would NEVER be able to tell this is cheeseless. Here's the breakdown.
.
1 block extra firm tofu (not pressed)
1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight or boiled for 30 minutes
1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt & pepper
Big handful of spinach2 cups cooked pasta of choice
.
✅Preheat the oven to 400F.
.
💪🏻Place your tofu, cashew, salt, nutritional yeast, garlic powder and apple cider vinegar in the blender. Combine until a smooth paste is formed.
.
👍Place the cherry tomatoes in a deep baking dish, and drizzle with olive oil. Pour the tofu ""feta"" in the middle, and top with more salt and pepper. Pop in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the tomatoes have bursted.
.
👏Stir with a spoon until the tomatoes and ""feta"" meld together, and add a handful of spinach into the mix. Pour in your pasta, and mix until coated with the sauce. Enjoy
.
👍What should I veganize next?💕

qpiJiZBQbT4,Baked Feta Pasta Recipe ( TikTok Pasta ) 😋🖤 #shorts #tiktokpasta #fetapasta,"Hi!

In this video, I show you how to make baked feta pasta , aka the TikTok pasta :)) This is a super easy pasta recipe, and you really don't need to know how to cook well to do this. I've seen a lot of different variations of this pasta on my YouTube Shorts feed, and I decided to make my own. What is different with this recipe is that I actually blend the baked feta, tomato and garlic to make a sauce. I don't think this is for everyone as it kind of softens the pasta, but I really enjoy it!

Let me know if you want more cooking videos from me :) I've really been enjoying making more homemade food lately, and I really like to make these chill ""how to"" videos. 

I think it's more trending with shorter, fast paced videos - but I also really enjoy to make this kind of content :)

hwLhmdN9f0c,Who else is still making the feta pasta in 2023?,"This viral pasta recipe has a chokehold on me since it first trended on TikTok in 2021. It’s now one of my staple meals that is quick and easy to make! 

Recipe:
Pasta of choice - cook based on box instructions 
crumbled feta
1 tbsp minced garlic 
Olive oil - measure with love
Basil (or other preferred herbs, I used parsley in this one)
Spinach (or other preferred leafy greens) 
Cherry tomatoes - about a dozen cut in half

Place all ingredients (aside from pasta) in an oven safe dish and bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Add spinach only in the last five minutes in the oven.

Add cooked pasta and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Top with Parmesan cheese optional.

------------------------------

Ingredients:
1 large box of Cherry Tomatoes.
1 pack of square feta cheese (square is funner than crumbled).
1 pack pasta (of your choice)
8 cloves chopped garlic 
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil
5-7 tbsps extra virgin oil
sea salt
1 tsp black pepper
optiona: chili flakes

Steps:
1. get the cherry tomatoes in a pyrex or oven safe cooking tray.
2. sprinkle evoo, salt, and black pepper and mix.
3. get the cheese in the centre, sprinkle a bit more evoo and the chili flakes. mix on the feta block.
4. get in the oven on 450ºF for 30 minutes or until the tomatoes and top of the cheese are browned.

Pasta:
1. get pot of water on high heat and add salt. Mix it and put cover back on.
2. Once reaches a rapid boil add in your pasta and stir. Follow the times on the packaging and aim for al dente.
3. Taste, and when ready, turn the heat off, strain the pasta (keep 1 cup of the pasta water). Rinse with a little bit of cool water.
4. Add them back to the pot, put the cover back on and leave it on the side.

Continuation:
5. when the feta and tomatoes are done, take them out and add in your garlic and basil right away.
6. with a spoon, break the cheese and mix it well into the tomatoes. Pop the tomatoes if they aren't already.
7. Add in your pasta and continue to mix well in order to make sure every pasta is covered with cheesy tomato goodness.

PRO TIP: if it is too dry or thick, add in some of the pasta water. This will loosen it up and leave a great sauce throughout.

8. Serve and ENJOY!
See? it is as good as everyone says!

Sweet cherry tomatoes and a block of feta cheese bake together with thyme, garlic, olive oil, pepper, and paprika until everything is soft and full of flavor. After smashing it all into a creamy sauce, just toss it with cooked pasta. For extra protein, I topped it with crispy fried chicken.

I felt healthy eating this, it might be not, but really so tasty, its a great quick dinner. 
Recipe 
1 zucchini 
200g feta cheese
1/2 green bell pepper
1 medium onion
3 cloves garlic
Olive oil
Salt n pepper
Red chilli flakes
Pasta of ur choice 

Method
Start by chopping your veggies, and lining up on a sheet tray or baking tray, with block of feta in the middle. 

Drizzle generously with olive oil, pepper and red chilli flakes. When u put the salt be careful as feta is very salty. Roast in the oven for 40mins on 230c. 

Boil your heavily salted water for cooking pasta. I m using maccheroni, but use any chunky pasta. I cooked mine as per the instructions on packaging that was 7mins.

Finally when the veggies are roasted and feta is melty, assemble everything well. Sprinkle more red chilli flakes while eating.

2. Using a baking dish add the tomatoes , extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper and mix to combine. Then, add the feta cheese right in the middle, top with garlic, dried oregano( optional ) or any available herbs. 
3. While we bake the tomatoes and feta cheese, cook the pasta of choice according to package direction, drain and set aside.
4. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cherry tomatoes burst and garlic turns brown.

rrbXkpDFUQY,✨KETO BAKED FETA PASTA✨ Details below 👇🏼,"The @kaizenfoodco #lowcarb cavatappi noodles make this viral sensation possible for even us carb counters to enjoy. I served this to my whole family and no one knew it wasn’t “real” pasta!

INGREDIENTS

-8 ounces cavatappi pasta or pasta of choice, I used @kaizen
-2 pints organic cherry tomatoes
-8 ounce block feta cheese
-½ cup extra virgin olive oil
-¼ teaspoon salt
-¼ teaspoon black pepper
-¼ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
-¼ teaspoon onion powder (optional)
-2 garlic cloves minced (I used 4)
-¼ cup packed chopped fresh basil
-parmesan & red pepper flakes for serving

INSTRUCTIONS

1) Preheat oven to 400°F. Place the cherry tomatoes in an oven-safe baking dish. Pour the olive oil on top, and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Toss until well combined.

2) Place the feta block in the middle of the baking dish surrounded by the cherry tomatoes, and flip a couple times to coat it with the olive oil and seasoning.

3) Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, until the cherry tomatoes burst, and the feta cheese melts.

4) While the tomatoes and feta are baking, cook the pasta in a pot of salted water according to package instructions until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup of the cooking liquid in case you’d like to toss it in.

5) Immediately add the garlic and basil leaves to the cooked tomatoes and feta and toss everything to combine.

6) Transfer the cooked pasta to the baking dish and toss to combine. Garnish with parmesan and red pepper flakes and serve warm. Enjoy!

This viral baked feta pasta recipe is a simple recipe made by oven roasting a block of vegan feta cheese with cherry tomatoes to create a salty and cheesy sauce!

Viral Baked Feta Pasta Recipe ingredients: 
8 ounces pasta 
2 pints cherry tomatoes
8- ounce vegan block feta cheese
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
¼ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
2 garlic cloves minced 

Viral Baked Feta Pasta Recipe instructions: 

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

Place the cherry tomatoes around the pasta in the baking dish.

Place the feta cheese block in the center of the baking dish, nestled among the tomatoes.

In a small bowl, combine the extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic cloves, sea salt, and black pepper. Stir well to mix the ingredients.

Pour the olive oil mixture over the pasta, tomatoes, and feta cheese. Make sure to evenly distribute the mixture, coating the ingredients.

Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the tomatoes have burst, the feta cheese has softened, and the pasta is cooked to your desired tenderness. You can adjust the baking time based on your preference for softer or firmer pasta.

Once baked, remove the dish from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes.

Before serving, gently stir the baked pasta, tomatoes, and melted feta cheese together. The feta cheese should easily break apart and create a creamy sauce with the olive oil and tomatoes.

Serve the baked feta pasta warm as a main dish or as a side. You can garnish it with fresh herbs like basil or parsley if desired.

Enjoy your delicious baked feta pasta with cherry tomato

3Yf6WSRkGE8,Healthy #Viralpasta - Baked Feta Pasta recipe,"I am sure you have seen the #viralpasta videos going around Tik Tok and Instagram. Here is my healthy take on this with courgetti/zucchini noodles and spinach to make it nutritious and delicious.

Here is the recipe:
1 punnet cherry tomatoes
1 red pepper, sliced
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic, sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
1 block of feta of your choice ( I have used dairy free version)
2 courgettes/zucchinis shredded to long noodles 
1 big handful of spinach

Method:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius
In your baking dish mix together cherry tomatoes, peppers, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.
Place the feta in the middle and drizzle with touch more of olive oil and some extra seasoning.
Pop in the oven and bake for around 30 minutes or until the tomatoes are cooked (soft to touch) and the feta is slightly melting.
Once the feta is cooked, mash up all the tomatoes and feta with a fork.
Add in the courgette noodles and spinach and enjoy while still warm.

xQzElu-4WPU,Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta | Baked Feta Pasta TikTok Recipe | Cooking Up Love,"Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta is the Tik Tok feta pasta recipe everyone’s talking about and it's so easy and very delicious. Our version uses feta crumbles and if you’re like me, I don’t have a block of feta in the fridge but I do have feta crumbles, and with these, tomatoes and pasta, you’ll be serving up this super tasty dish in no time!

Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta Ingredients
3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
5 cloves garlic (optional)
salt & pepper to taste
1/2 tsp oregano
avocado or olive oil
1/2 lb pasta, cooked (about half a box)

Roasted Tomato Feta Pasta Directions
Begin preheating the oven to 400 degrees, and spread about a tablespoon of avocado or olive oil across a sheet pan. Next, slice 3 cups of cherry tomatoes in half. The original TikTok baked feta pasta recipe bakes the whole tomatoes until they burst, I'm using our favorite way to roast tomatoes, laying them cut side up on an oiled baking sheet. As they roast, the tomatoes will become rich, with a deep caramelized flavor and a little sweetness. I’m also tucking a few garlic cloves here to roast along with the tomatoes, which I’ll squeeze a bit into the pasta and use it to make garlic bread. Sprinkle with a few teaspoons of avocado or olive oil, then a little salt, pepper and oregano, I love oregano with roasted tomatoes, you could also use thyme or like the original TikTok feta tomato pasta recipe, basil.

Place into the 400 degree oven and bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan and remove the garlic. Bake for another 10 - 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and add 4 - 5 tablespoons of feta crumbles. Place the baking sheet back in the oven for 5 - 10 minutes.

While the tomatoes and feta finish roasting, prepare the pasta according to the directions on the box. Drain and shake off the pasta water, and add to a mixing bowl. Then just add the roasted tomatoes and feta… stir and serve! A delicious tomato feta pasta bake!

Tiktok baked feta pasta is my new favorite TikTok recipe :D it turned out pretty delicious! Have you discovered a new recipe on TikTok?! List it in the comments!

w-DuhZwg3aQ,Viral Baked Feta  & Tomato Pasta,"Baked Feta & Tomato Pasta—rich, creamy, and full of flavor with a little twist of sun-dried tomatoes and Cajun spice.

Ingredients:
Grape Tomatoes
Garlic (chopped)
Sun-Dried Tomatoes (chopped)
Fresh Basil (chopped)
Feta Cheese (block or crumbled)
Olive Oil
Salt
Black Pepper
Cajun Seasoning
Pasta of choice

Steps:
 1. Wash grape tomatoes and place them in an oven-safe pan.
 2. Add chopped garlic, drizzle olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning.
 3. Add your feta cheese—block gives a creamier texture, but crumbled works too.
 4. Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes.
 5. Meanwhile, boil your pasta (don’t forget to salt the water!).
 6. Once the tomato-feta mix is roasted, mash and stir to your desired consistency.
 7. Add in your cooked pasta, chopped basil, and sun-dried tomatoes. Mix and serve hot!

Tips:
 • Block feta melts creamier—try it if you’re after that rich texture.
 • Add red chili flakes or lemon zest for a little extra kick or brightness.",,2025-04-10 23:04:39+00:00,1157,0,1,PT1M,2025-10-15 20:44:02.450266+00:00,feta pasta recipe,60.0,0.000864304235090752,187.90235474844908,Longer_Video,32

This recipe makes 2 medium servings
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Instant coffee
2 tablespoons Sugar
2 tablespoons Hot water
1/2 cup (120ml) Milk of your choice 
2-3 Ice cubes


Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl place coffee, sugar and hot water (1:1:1 ratio). 
2. Using a hand mixer or electric mixer, whisk until thick and creamy.
3. Fill only 3/4 of a cup with cold milk and add ice cubes. 
4. Top it up with foamy whipped coffee. Mix well before drink. Enjoy!

Notes:
• Do I have to use sugar? The sugar helps the coffee whip to a fluffy and stable texture that holds its shape for a while. You can reduce sugar amount, but I’m not sure it will be so fluffy. If you’re really sensitive to sugar, you can reduce it down, just know that your coffee won’t be as fluffy.
• What kind of milk to use: You can use cow’s milk, dairy free milk such as almond milk, oat milk or any other kind of milk that you prefer.
• Can I make Dalgona coffee without electric mixer?  Yes, you can whip the coffee using a regular whisk, it may take a little bit more time, but it absolutely possible.

B2cZCl-Um_I,Dalgona Coffee Recipe | How to Make Whipped Coffee | Frothy Coffee,"Dalgona Coffee THREE different ways: Classic, Mochaccino, and Iced! Lets get started!

Dalgona Coffee, made popular in Tiktok, is also known as Frothy Coffee, Whipped Coffee, or Cloud Coffee. You whip equal parts of instant coffee, sugar, and hot water together until they’re thick and frothy. Then, you fill your cup with ice and the milk of your choice, topping your glass with a cloud of coffee-flavored foam. Even better? If you don’t drink coffee, or if you don’t have any instant coffee on hand, you can make the recipe using instant hot chocolate powder instead!

The coffee froth is said to be made by stirring 400 times, earning the drink the nickname ""400 coffee.""

It has also been called ""dalgona coffee"" because it looks similar to the Korean toffee candy, and ""Macau coffee"" since it originated from Macau. 😊

Recently I've been getting quite a number of requests to make dalgona coffee so I gave it a try.
Hopefully it's not too late ahaha
On TV (Korean) they tell you to whisk around 400 times, but that's bs.
In reallity it's closer to 4000 times lol
I don't really like coffee (Only coffee related things that I like are coffee milk and tiramisu) but this one I kinda liked it.
it tastes like a sweeter and creamier version of coffee milk.
If you don't like milk, you can just use water instead
But is it worth my arm? idk...
BTW there's a video on dalgona as well so have a look if you are interested :)

Ingredients:
Instant coffee x3 Tbsp, Sugar x3 Tbsp, Water x3 Tbsp (or slightly less), Milk x?, Ice x?

This recipe makes 2 medium servings
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Instant coffee
2 tablespoons Sugar
2 tablespoons Hot water
1 cocoa powder
1/2 cup (120ml) Milk of your choice, cold or hot
2-3 Ice cubes if you making cold coffee

Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl place coffee, sugar and hot water (1:1:1 ratio). 
2. Using a hand mixer or electric mixer, whisk until thick and creamy. When its thick and creamy add cocoa powder and keep whisking until combined and thick, and creamy. 
3. Fill only 3/4 of a cup with cold milk and add ice cubes. 
4. Top with foamy whipped coffee, grate some dark chocolat. Mix well before drink. Enjoy!

Notes:
• Do I have to use sugar? The sugar helps the coffee whip to a fluffy and stable texture that holds its shape for a while. You can reduce sugar amount, but I’m not sure it will be so fluffy. If you’re really sensitive to sugar, you can reduce it down, just know that your coffee won’t be as fluffy.
• What kind of milk to use: You can use cow’s milk, dairy free milk such as almond milk, oat milk or any other kind of milk that you prefer.
• Cold or hot milk? For this recipe you can use cold or hot milk, they both taste great. If you are using cold milk, add few ice cubes.
• Can I make Dalgona coffee without electric mixer?  Yes, you can whip the coffee using a regular whisk, it may take a little bit more time, but it absolutely possible.

The most popular coffee trending during the lockdown in the year 2020 in the world.
This trending coffee recipe got viral over TikTok and was first made in Korea.
Dalgona Chocolate Coffee is just the opposite of what cappuccino coffee is. It has velvety smooth coffee floating on top of hot or cold milk. My version of Dalgona coffee uses a little chocolate powder making it chocolate Dalgona coffee.

gAXDkbjZNGY,Winter Special Dalgona Coffee☕❄ At Home! Must Try! Easy Winter Coffee! Hot Dalgona Coffee😋,"Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.

It was popularized on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic , when people refraining from going out started making videos of whipping the coffee at home, by hand without using electrical mixers . 

The name is derived from dalgona , a Korean sugar sweet, due to the resemblance in taste and appearance, though most dalgona coffee doesn't actually contain dalgona.

Try out this winter coffee and let me know your views in the comments below!

BKuk9-RrXK8,Keto Dalgona Coffee Recipe [Fluffy Whipped Coffee],"If you’ve spent any time on social media recently, chances are you have happened across Korean dalgona coffee, commonly known as whipped coffee. Light and fluffy, dalgona coffee is a whipped coffee mixture served over iced milk. It’s a fun way to change up how you get your caffeine fix. Not only does it taste great, but the dual layers look amazing too—making for an impressive drink to serve to friends and family. 

The traditional Korean recipe calls for powdered sugar, which isn’t keto friendly. Some keto recipes use erythritol, but we chose allulose. You really don’t notice the difference, as it leaves your coffee tasting sweet and nicely compliments the other flavors in the drink. 

Just because the dalgona coffee looks fancy doesn’t mean it’s difficult to make. It is merely coffee, allulose and hot water whipped together to create an intense, fluffy coffee foam. 

This coffee foam is extremely intense in flavor, so you’ll need milk to balance it out. Spoon the foam over a glass of iced milk of your choice (we love almond milk) then serve!

You can choose whether to mix the two layers together, or drink it through a straw and get a little bit of each at once. Either way, make sure to consume your dalgona coffee immediately for maximum flavor.

This coffee has so many names; Dalgona Coffee, frothy coffee, whipped Coffee, cloud Coffee, magic coffee and more. No matter how you call it, this cold coffee is AMAZING! This coffee has been viral in Korea during quarantine time, then it got viral on TikTok and now it is very trendy all over the internet. Dalgona Coffee is a cold latte drink that comes with a velvety smooth and sweet coffee foam on top. The combination of cold milk and the bittersweet coffee is absolutely delicious. Dalgona coffee is inspired by the South Korean dalgona candy, a toffee sponge that resembles the creamy dollop that tops the ice coffee. You can make this coffee hot as well as cold. So if you want to learn how to make dalgona coffee, follow this easy recipe (only 4 ingredients).
This recipe makes 2 medium servings Ingredients: 
2 tablespoons Instant coffee 
2 tablespoons Sugar 
2 tablespoons Hot water 
1/2 cup (120ml) Milk of your choice 
2-3 Ice cubes 
Directions: 
1. In a large mixing bowl place coffee, sugar and hot water (1:1:1 ratio). 
2. Using a hand mixer or electric mixer, whisk until thick and creamy. 
3. Fill only 3/4 of a cup with cold milk and add ice cubes. 
4. Top it up with foamy whipped coffee. 

Mix well before drink. Enjoy! Notes: • Do I have to use sugar? The sugar helps the coffee whip to a fluffy and stable texture that holds its shape for a while. You can reduce sugar amount, but I’m not sure it will be so fluffy. If you’re really sensitive to sugar, you can reduce it down, just know that your coffee won’t be as fluffy. • What kind of milk to use: You can use cow’s milk, dairy free milk such as almond milk, oat milk or any other kind of milk that you prefer. • Can I make Dalgona coffee without electric mixer? Yes, you can whip the coffee using a regular whisk, it may take a little bit more time, but it absolutely possible.
coffee beverage has many variations across the globe. it is typically served as refreshing beverage drink for early morning or after a long day in the evening. however it can also be served as social drink with friends and family. one such viral drink especially during the covid-19 lockdown is dalgona coffee recipe.

Cdx-8Jx5VK0,Keto Dalgona Coffee Recipe - TRENDING DALGONA COFFEE - Slimsnacks Keto Lab,"#DalgonaCoffee #TrendingDalgona #DalgonaAtHome

Today, how about you make an amazing keto dalgona coffee at home, and yes, while on quarantine?
I think this is one of the best iced coffee I've ever tasted mainly because of that luxurious whipped coffee cream.

Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee (Nescafe sticks), sugar and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.

It is not possible to make Dalgona coffee using ground coffee beans; instant coffee creates the dense and foamy topping and the reason for this has much to do with the drying process of the coffee granules.

The drink is based on an Indian drink known as Phenti Hui coffee (or beaten coffee). The only difference is that when making Phenti Hui, milk is poured on top of the whipped mix rather than spooning the whipped mix on top of the milk. Its viral status on social media came as a result of Jung Il-woo, a South Korean actor who visited an eatery in Macau where he was served a similar beverage reminding him of ""dalgona"", a type of Korean honeycomb toffee, and later presented on a South Korean TV show called Stars' Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant (“신상출시 편스토랑”).

Due to the mass sharing of this viral aesthetically pleasing beverage on not only social media, a lot of other instagram influencers have jumped into the bandwagon and expand the wave even wider. Under the hashtag #dalgonacoffeechallenge, homemade versions of dalgona coffee began spreading on South Korean YouTube channels before going viral on TikTok.

Dalgona coffee is made from just three ingredients — instant coffee, sugar, and water. Combine equal parts of each ingredient in a bowl, then using a hand mixer, mix until you get a caramel-colored frothy mixture. 

If you don’t have a hand mixer, it can be whipped by hand, just know the process takes a little bit longer. Once it’s ready, pour on top of your milk of choice with the cream, and voila — you have an exciting new coffee drink, and you’re one step closer to becoming a master barista.

zamZpwtuw9o,Dalgona Coffee Using a Keurig Pod! | K-cup Dalgona Coffee | Dalgona Coffee Hack,"WHAT THE HACK!!!  

My hack for the Dalgona Coffee thing.  I wanted to test out this coffee craze using what I already had in my kitchen!  

Disclaimer 1:  Indeed I have already tried the normal recipe of 2 Tbsp. Instant Coffee, 2 Tbsp Sugar, and 2 Tbsp Hot Water, and it was easy and delish.  
Disclaimer 2:  My thumbnail cover is NOT the pic of my original attempt!  The true results lies within the video, but it was my first video and I didn’t realize I was gonna get these many views of the experiment!  After making more videos, I wanted to have this thumbnail match up with the others.  *shrugs*

Basically, the Keurig way worked meh-okay except it was lighter in color, and not as whipped as the original recipe.  I attributed this to the volume I started with, which was the smallest cup setting on my Keurig (150mL or 2/3 cup).  Next time, I’ll try it with the 2 Tbsp measurement.  Result:  pretty darn sweet, but I like sweet.  I think I have the whipped coffee to last for a month with that 1 pod.  I would probably whip the thing for another 10 minutes, but I was impatient.  Not bad for an experiment!  

UPDATE (04-07-2020):  I kept the rest in the fridge and it separated. Tried to whip it up again and it didn’t peak much. The next day I tried to whip it up with about 1/4 Tsp of Cream of Tartar, which is used to create meringue, and it actually came back to life, and even whipped up better than the original.  HOWEVER, it seemed to have a slightly bitter taste, and when I tried to top off warm milk instead, and even a hot cup of coffee, the bugger disintegrated and ended up looking like baby barf. I refrigerated the topping again, and the next day it slightly separated.  Stick to iced milk.",dalgona|dalgonacoffee|dalgonakeurig|keurigcoffee|keurigpod|coffeedrink|coffeefoam|whippedcoffee|sweetdrinks|dalgona coffee with keurig|dalgona coffee with k-cups|k-cups|sumatra coffee|sweet drink|korean coffee drink|dalgona coffee|dalgona keurig|keurig coffee|whipped coffee|keurig pod|coffee drink|frappe|coffee foam|k-cup dalgona|cream of tartar recipies|sugar drink|folgers instant coffee|maxwell house instant coffee|experiment keurig dalgona coffee,2020-04-02 18:55:41+00:00,22041,124,10,PT1M47S,2025-10-15 20:44:09.687202+00:00,dalgona coffee recipe,107.0,0.006079578966471576,2022.0753320278006,Longer_Video,79

Thank you so much for watching! ☺️

We both loved coffee so we decided to try doing the dalgona coffee at home which is trending nowadays at social media. We do not have electric mixer and wire whisk that’s why we used fork instead.. As for the texture, we prefer the fluffy or whipped cream type so we stirred the mixture for about 30 minutes 😅

You can used any brand of powdered milk, and black coffee that you have at home 😊

We will be doing the Milo Dalgona soon ☺️

zWwzftgUB2U,Dalgona Coffee With Collagen | Sugar Free Whipped Keto Coffee,"A simple twist on the world world-renowned whipped (Dalgona) coffee that adds some incredible benefits for your skin, hair and nails.  
 Full Recipe:https://justbloom.co/blogs/recipes/no-bake-collagen-boosted-energy-bars

We used pure unflavored collagen to get the best results in terms of creaminess: visit https://justbloom.co/products/just-bloom-unflavored-collagen-peptides for 20% off and get free shipping.

There Are Only FIVE INGREDIENTS:
● 2 Tbsp  Instant Coffee
● 3-4 Tbsp of your favorite no calorie sweetener (standard sugar optional - not keto)
● 12 grams (1 packet) Just Bloom Pure Unflavored Collagen
● 2 tbsp hot water (or milk)
● ½ cup of ice

Prep
1. Add the instant coffee, pure collagen and water and sweetener to a large mixing bowl.  You can use natural sweetener like agave or stevia. 
2. Using a hand whisk or electric mixer, blend the mixture on high until it is frothy and creamy. Its best to use an electric mixer if you have one. This should take about 2-3 minutes.
3. Taste and add more sweetener if desired or mix in some sugar if you are not on keto.
4. Using a standard mason jar or a tall glass (about 8ounces/1cup) add a half a cup or 4-5 cubes of ice and pour your favorite milk on top. We used whole milk, but almond milk is also nice and creamy and has a nice sweet texture.
5. Using a spoon, scoop up the cream and pour the whipped coffee mixture on top of the iced.  Blend or stir so that some of the coffee flavor drizzles into the milk.
6.  SERVE AND ENJOY : )

Order on Amazon Today! FREE DELIVERY TO YOUR DOOR

Just bloom is on a mission to put the tasty back into healthy, empowering women, and making  collagen a family friendly routine that everyone can look forward to.

Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey. It was popularized on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people refraining from going out started making videos of whipping the coffee at home, by hand without using electrical mixers. The name is derived from dalgona, a Korean sugar sweet, due to the resemblance in taste and appearance, though most dalgona coffee doesn't actually contain dalgona.


Dalgona Coffee Recipe Easy:
This recipe makes 2 medium servings
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Instant coffee
2 tablespoons Sugar
2 tablespoons Hot water
1/2 cup (120ml) milk of your choice 
2-3 Ice cubes


Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl place coffee, sugar, and hot water (1:1:1 ratio). 
2. Using a hand mixer or electric mixer, whisk until thick and creamy.
3. Fill only 3/4 of a cup with cold milk and add ice cubes. 
4. Top it up with foamy whipped coffee. Mix well before drink.

Pwede kayong gumamit ng hand mixer medyo matagal nga lang bago nyo makuha ang tamang consistency pero masarap pa rin naman. Mas maganda kung whip cream ang gagamitin nyo kay sa all-purpose cream medyo malabnaw kasi ang all-purpose cream hindi katulad ng whip cream mas thick yung consistency nya.

Since most people are having more time stuck at home ( and please keep it that way, STAY AT HOME thank you), this could be a good way to be pre-occupied and experiment on new things. Mind you this could be a good exercise too specifically to those who are going to do it the harder way, like me lol.

DALGONA COFFEE

Ingredients
1-2 tbsp sugar ( adjust to your preference. I put 1 tbsp only)
1-2 tbsp coffee granules ( adjust to your preference)
2 tbsp hot water
Milk of your choice

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Put sugar, coffee granules and hot water on a mixing bowl.
2. Whisk everything until brown and thick, almost like a whipped cream consistency. Some people like it less thick, adjust the whisking time to your preference.
3. Put milk of choice on a mug.

Dalgona coffee at it’s best!! Make this super sensational whipped coffee at home with just 4 ingredients and you will love everything about it! Named after the Korean toffee flavored street candy, it resembles in appearance, texture, and color, Dalgona coffee has become wildly popular. What sets it apart from other coffee beverages is the unusual method that creates an almost mousse-like foam that floats atop a glass of milk, seemingly suspended there like a coffee-flavored cloud.

Enjoy this homemade recipe of Internet-famous Dalgona Whipped Coffee made with instant coffee and sugar and served over cold non-dairy milk. Make it a little bit healthier and add more fun with pink raspberry milk and pink raspberry-coffee whip!

Prep Time: 10 min | Cook Time: 0 min | Total Time: 10 min | Servings: 1

INGREDIENTS:
• 2 tbsp of instant coffee granules
• 2 tbsp of hot water
• 2 tbsp of cane sugar
• 2 tbsp raspberry powder (https://foodtolive.com/shop/organic-raspberry-powder/)
• Handful of ice
• 1 1/2  cup plant-based milk

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In a blender, combine 1 tbsp raspberry powder and plant-based milk. Blend until the mixture is smooth and the raspberry powder is fully incorporated.
2. In a bowl, add your coffee granules along with cane sugar, hot water, and remaining 1 tbsp raspberry powder. This will not only add a fruity twist but also give the cream a lovely pink hue.
3. Whisk the mixture vigorously for about 5-8 min, or until it becomes thick and creamy.
4. Fill a glass with ice cubes. Pour the raspberry-infused milk into the glass, leaving some space at the top.
5. Spoon the thick and creamy coffee mixture you prepared earlier on top of the raspberry milk.
6. Your Raspberry Coffee Cream is now ready to be enjoyed! Stir gently if you like, and savor the refreshing blend of raspberry and coffee flavors.

MzIen6fSQwA,making a matcha latte at home 🍵,"matcha latte at home 🍵 ~

Making myself a cup of matcha is one of the things I look forward to most in the morning. It’s almost peaceful, in a way - and I feel so energized after.

The most important ingredient is, of course, the matcha. You want to use the highest quality for drinking, which is ceremonial grade. It is pricy, but you’re going to save so much money compared to spending $8 each time at a cafe.

* the matcha I’m using is from @tenzotea — you can use my code for a discount! JASMINE15

For today's matcha I used soy milk with a splash of homemade maple syrup (the best kind). On most days though, I’ll drink it the traditional way with just water and matcha. Experiment and see which flavor combinations you like best!

4rhdVa9MNYk,Is this homemade MATCHA BOBA actually worth the effort?,"Is this homemade MATCHA BOBA actually worth the effort?

✨Recipe: 
✨Prepare the brown sugar boba pearls: In a small saucepan, combine the 1/3cup water and 1/3cup light brown sugar. Heat mixture over high heat until boiling. Reduce the heat to low and mix in 1/2cup of tapioca starch, stirring constantly for 6-8 seconds. Remove from heat and mix in another 1/2cup of tapioca starch until a dough just begins to form. 
Dump the dough out onto a work surface and knead until a smooth dough forms, about 1 minute or so. Working quickly, as the dough will dry up if it cools too much, divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each piece into a long rod and then cut and form into little balls. 
✨Place the boba pearls into a bowl with tapioca starch and toss to coat. Dump the boba into a fine-mesh sieve to shake off the excess tapioca starch. 
✨To cook the boba pearls, heat a medium pot of water over medium-high heat until boiling. Add the pearls and boil for 30 minutes. Cut the heat and let the pearls rest in the water for 20-25 minutes or until translucent and chewy. 
✨Make the Brown Sugar Syrup:  To a small saucepot, add 6 1/2 TBLS of water and 1 1/4cup light brown sugar and swirl to combine. Place over medium heat and cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts to bubble. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil vigorously to reduce the liquid into a syrup. Drain the pearls through a fine-mesh strainer. Stir into the syrup mixture along with 1 tbls of blackstrap molasses. 
✨To assemble with traditional milk tea, add 2cups of whole milk to a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the milk until it reaches 162°F (72°C), stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and mix in 5 black tea bags. Let steep for 4-8 minutes, or until it reaches the desired strength of flavor. Refrigerate until completely cold. To a tall glass, spoon in as many boba pearls as desired and top with desired amount of syrup. Add in the ice cubes before pouring in the chilled milk tea and serve. 
✨To assemble the matcha, I used a specific boba matcha powder. Heat 2 cups milk like above, and pour in the matcha according to package. Assemble the same way as above. Enjoy! 😉",littleremyfood|little remy food|little|remy|food|shorts|viral|trend|i tried|the best|comfort food|boba|bubble tea|tapioca|tapioca pearls|homemeade|home made|homemade boba|homemade bubble tea,2024-05-29 19:59:11+00:00,5875794,296079,482,PT25S,2025-10-15 20:44:17.313996+00:00,matcha latte recipe,25.0,0.050471646895721665,504.0313230786574,Short,55

Matcha link: https://mizubatea.com/?rfsn=8679532.232417

i used to struggle to make my matcha lattes taste good, but after lots of trial and error, i finally figured out how to make my perfect latte! hopefully this helps you if you’re struggling too 💚

what other tips do you have that i missed?

matcha mistakes you might be making:
1. using a low quality matcha
2. using too little matcha
3. using too much water
4. using boiling water
5. using overpowering milk
6. using too much milk

p.s. for the milk ratio, i usually just add an additional 10ml of milk for every additional gram of matcha I use! So 3g matcha/80ml milk, 4g matcha/90ml milk, 5g matcha/100ml milk, 6g matcha/110ml milk, etc. This helps keep the matcha flavor strong! 💚

KVMLtswDMQM,Avoid This Type of Milk With Your Matcha Latte 🙅🏻‍♀️,"The answer, if you ask me, is any plant milk you like BUT I would not recommend dairy milk, and I promise I’m not just saying that because I’m vegan.

When you mix matcha directly with milk, the casein protein in dairy milk binds to polyphenols in matcha, alters the bioavailability and blocks absorption of antioxidants. In short, you’re missing out on potential health benefits that matcha has to offer.

The good news is, this isn’t an issue with plant milk, so opt for something like oat, almond, soy or whatever else you’d like! It’s better for the planet anyway 🙂

New to matcha green tea?
People are going crazy for matcha. We get it – it’s energizing, healthy and makes a killer green tea latte. So how is matcha different from regular green tea? Matcha powder is made from finely ground green tea leaves – so with every sip, you’re actually consuming all the delicious benefits of the full leaf. 

Matcha Benefits
This superstar green tea powder is popular for lots of reasons – think fresh flavour, energizing kick and bigtime benefits for your mind, body and mood. Because you’re ingesting the entire leaf, you get every last nutrient and antioxidant green tea has to offer. 

And matcha is super versatile. We especially love it on its own, as a green tea latte, added to cakes and smoothies and sipped as a fresh and fruity iced matcha. Whether you like yours sweet or neat, matcha is one trendy superfood everyone can get behind. And it’s surprisingly fast and easy to make matcha at home.

DAVIDsTEA Matchas
All of our matcha is sourced from Nishio, Japan – the region known for producing the world’s finest matcha for the past 800 years. And because we believe there’s a matcha for everyone, we offer a range of grades and flavours, from sweet and fruity stone-ground blends to ultra-premium matchas used in traditional tea ceremonies. Here are four of our most popular matchas:

Matcha Matsu
This fresh, grassy tea powder has all the aroma of a Japanese tea garden – plus it can hold its own when mixed into tea lattes, milkshakes, cookies and more.

Ceremonial Matcha
Calling all matcha lovers! This is our creamiest, sweetest, most delicate matcha tea yet. It whisks into a bright emerald, smooth-drinking tea fit for an emperor.

Peach Matcha
An all-natural blend of stone-ground matcha green tea, pure cane sugar and fruity notes of peach, this flavoured matcha will make you totally rethink your morning smoothie.
Buy it now: http://bit.ly/2HU2KJ2

Vanilla Matcha
With a creamy hint of vanilla and the sweetness of coconut nectar, this stone-ground matcha is one of our all-time faves. Sip solo or add it to just about anything.

Strawberry Matcha Recipe:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh strawberries
- 2 tbsp sugar 
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tsp high quality Matcha powder 
- 1/3 cup boiling hot water (for the Tea)
- Ice
- 1/2 cup whole milk

Preparation:
First I start by making a strawberry compote. In a small saucepan, i'm adding 2 cups of freshly chopped strawberries, stemmed and quartered. Fresh strawberries are the sweetest when they are in season, but if they aren't, i prefer to use frozen strawberries because they're picked and frozen at its peak. I'll add in 2 tbsps of sugar and 2 tbsps of water. I'll cook them down on medium heat, stirring every so often until the strawberries are soft and the sauce is nice and syrupy. This will take about 10 minutes. Once it's done, i'll give it a good mash to make sure we don't have any chunky bits. Then I'll set it aside to cool. The leftover can be stored in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Next i'll make my matcha green tea mixture. It's no secret that matcha green tea is one of my favorite ingredients. It's basically finely ground powdered green tea powder. 
A lot of you have asked in my other matcha recipes - where can I get it and what should I look for? I really love matcha green tea like this one that's made in Japan. That's where matcha originated so they have the highest quality teas. 

I'm adding 1 tsp of matcha powder to my bowl along with 1/3 cup of boiling hot water. Using my bamboo whisk, i'll whisk it vigorously until the tea becomes nice and frothy. 

Now mix it all together. For boba lovers out there, you can start by adding tapioca pearls but I love grass jelly so that's what I'm going to use. Next i'll add in ¼ cup of the strawberry compote, then filling the rest of my glass with ice. Then I'll add a layer of whole milk until it reaches ⅔ of the way up and finally topping it off with my matcha green tea. 

Does this look amazing, or what? Quality ingredients, awesome drink! Thanks to Boba Guys (http://www.bobaguys.com/) for this drink inspiration! I'll see you at our next coffee break. Bye!!

🌸 my sakura chasen charm is from @BijouxKomorebi! (my small jewelry business) 🩷 shop here: https://bijouxkomorebi.com/products/sakura-chasen-charm

💡 STEPS: 
1️⃣ use a high quality matcha powder (i used Mizuba Tea Co’s Daily matcha - https://bit.ly/42IwLbP). does not need to be “ceremonial” grade. however, “culinary” grade might not produce your desired results. you may just need to use trial and error with what you have!

2️⃣ sift 3g matcha with 30ml of water at 170°F / 77°C. i like to use a 1:10 ratio of matcha to water. also, sifting helps remove clumps and produces a smoother end result

3️⃣ whisk vigorously yet gently in a W back-and-forth motion for 30 seconds until large bubbles form

4️⃣ slow down your speed and whisk just the surface to break up the large bubbles. do this for another 30 seconds or so. you may need to whisk longer and/or slower to break up the bubbles

that’s it! your foam should look glassy and smooth. enjoy it as is or over a cup of milk 🥛

Ube Cream Matcha Latte: A Bold Fusion with My New Matcha Ceremonia Kit
There’s nothing quite like the moment when you find your new favorite drink—especially when it’s a colorful, delicious, and unique blend of flavors. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with the Ube Cream Matcha Latte, a drink that combines the smooth earthiness of matcha with the rich, creamy taste of ube. What makes it even more special is creating it using my new matcha essential kit, which elevates the experience to a whole new level!

Today, I’m sharing the recipe for this dreamy Ube Cream Matcha Latte, and trust me, once you try it, you’ll be hooked too.

What You'll Need:
Matcha (~2 tsps)
Milk (100ml)
Heavy Cream (50ml)
Ube Extract (1 tbsp, add sugar if you want it sweeter)
Ladyfinger (for garnish)
How to Make Ube Cream Matcha Latte
Step 1: Cold Whisked Matcha
The base of this latte starts with a beautifully whisked matcha. I use 2 teaspoons of matcha and whisk it with 100ml of cold milk using the tools from my matcha ceremonia kit. The bamboo whisk creates a perfectly smooth and frothy matcha blend that is absolutely essential for achieving the right texture and flavor.

Pro Tip: Whisk in a “W” motion to create an even froth. This technique, combined with the traditional whisk from the kit, ensures your matcha is well-blended and free of clumps.

Step 2: Ube Cream
Next comes the star of the drink—ube cream. In a small bowl, whip 50ml of heavy cream with 1 tablespoon of ube extract. You can adjust the sweetness by adding sugar to taste, but I personally love the subtle sweetness of ube on its own. The result is a thick, luscious purple cream that’s full of rich flavor.

Step 3: Layering the Drink
Pour the cold whisked matcha into a glass, and then gently spoon the ube cream on top. The visual contrast between the deep green matcha and the vibrant purple ube cream is stunning—it’s a feast for the eyes as much as it is for the taste buds!

Step 4: Topping It Off
For an extra treat, I like to top my Ube Cream Matcha Latte with a ladyfinger. It adds a delightful crunch and makes the experience of drinking this latte feel even more indulgent.

Why the Matcha Ceremonia Kit is a Must-Have
Ever since I got my matcha essential kit, making matcha has become more than just preparing a drink—it’s a mindful ritual that I look forward to every day. The bamboo whisk is perfect for creating the right consistency, and the whole kit brings an authentic and calming vibe to the process. Using the traditional tools helps me connect with the rich history of matcha preparation while also making it easier to achieve that perfect froth.

Final Thoughts
The Ube Cream Matcha Latte is not just a treat for the taste buds—it’s a drink that’s as visually striking as it is flavorful. The earthy notes of matcha blend perfectly with the creamy, nutty flavor of ube, and when you add in the elegance of the ceremonia kit, making this latte feels like a creative, satisfying process.

If you’re looking for something new to try, give this recipe a go! And don’t forget, a matcha essential kit can make all the difference in creating the perfect drink, helping you bring both tradition and taste into every cup.",swan latte art|leaf latte art|how to learn latte art|homebarista|cusinaverde|youtube shorts|viral youtube shorts|coffee series|how to reduce bloating|cure for bloating|healthy eating habits|tip and tricks in latte art|dalgona matcha|how to make dalgona coffee|traditional japenese tea|ceremonial green tea|how to latte art Wing Rose|cappuccino|surfing swan latte art|new coffee design|rose latte art|slow pour latte art|can I call you rose|frame tulips|ube,2024-10-24 20:26:17+00:00,429724,7005,59,PT17S,2025-10-15 20:44:17.827113+00:00,matcha latte recipe,17.0,0.016438458173153002,356.0125095730671,Short,99

🍵 Matcha Latte là thức uống ""quốc dân"" được rất nhiều người yêu thích. Thay vì chọn cho mình hương vị truyền thống vốn có, Matcha Latte sắp ra mắt tại VINBAR là phiên bản nâng cấp với sự góp mặt của Bột ÔLong Matcha Đặc Biệt Lộc Phát.

🍃 Đây là dòng bột được chế biến từ lá trà tươi ở Lâm Đồng, nhờ khí hậu mát lạnh quanh năm và đất đỏ bazan giàu dinh dưỡng nên khi sử dụng bột pha trà sẽ cho hậu vị ngọt dịu, sâu lắng. Hòa quyện với đó là vị sữa béo thơm rất hài hoà với trà. Nhờ vậy, thức uống này cực nịnh miệng và thơm dịu vô cùng.

Z-KLTEPGaAs,Matcha Latte (Hot Latte) Using Your Home Espresso Machine,"In this video we demonstrate how to make a delicious hot matcha latte at home using the steam wand from an espresso machine. 

TIP - To make matcha latte art, you need the matcha tea in the bowl to be full body (Some weight) just like an espresso. To make full body matcha, you need at least 3 - 4 grams of matcha powder and just a small amount of water approx 50ml so that the matcha is more like a thin paste. 

Use a good quality matcha powder if you want that fresh, vibrant green hue result.

eOnwuHhLNSo,Easy Matcha Latte Recipe (Hot or Iced) at Home,"In our recipe tutorial, we’ll show you two easy methods to create the perfect matcha latte, whether you prefer it iced or hot. 

🍴Ingredients you'll need for our recipe:
- 2 tsp (5g) green tea powder (https://amzn.to/4bPDTVc)
- 3 tbsp hot water (you want this around 80-85°C)
- Sugar or vanilla extract (optional but gets you closer to the Starbucks version)
- Milk or plant-based alternatives like soy, almond or oat
- Ice (optional)

👨🏼‍🍳 See our full recipe here: https://www.honestfoodtalks.com/matcha-latte-recipe/

Our first method will show you how to make an iced green tea latte without a whisk. Our second method will show you how to achieve the creamiest hot matcha latte with a milk frother.

🥣  Tools you'll need to make our easy recipe:
To mix the green tea powder, you can use a large jar or a leakproof tumbler. You can also use a bamboo whisk, electric handheld whisk, or milk frother. 

We love to use a bamboo whisk to froth the matcha, as it creates a deliciously creamy mircofoam top. In our opinion, this is the best tool you can use.

Składniki:
Syrop (3 porcje): 250 g borówek amerykańskich, 5 łyżek cukru, 5 łyżek wody

Matcha Latte (1 porcja, szklanka 250 ml):
3 g herbaty matcha (trzy chashaku), 30 ml wody, 3 łyżki syropu z borówek, 170 ml mleka (użyliśmy bez laktozy), 5 kostek lodu

Przygotowanie:
1. Do garnka włóż umyte borówki, dodaj cukier i wodę, a następnie zagotuj, aż owoce się rozpadną. Następnie dokładnie przeciśnij owoce przez sitko, aby uzyskać gęsty syrop.
2. Do chawanu lub szerokiego kubka wsyp proszek matcha i wlej 30 ml wody o temperaturze 80°C. Za pomocą chasena lub spieniacza wymieszaj matchę, aż na powierzchni powstanie piana.
3. Do szklanki wlej 3 łyżki przestudzonego syropu borówkowego, dodaj lód i mleko. Delikatnie zamieszaj, a następnie powoli wlej matchę na wierzch. Gotowe!

qzB9iXnX2O8,WHY I QUIT COFFEE // MY HONEY MATCHA LATTE,"I had no idea my 1-month experiment swapping coffee for matcha would make me such a die hard matcha fan 😆 When I started bringing awareness to my hormone health last year I took a long, hard look at what habits of mine weren't supporting healthy hormones and my morning double espresso latte started to set off alarm bells 🚨

I realized that coffee made me experience jitters and anxiety that manifested both physically (restlessness, sweating, shakiness) and mentally (irritability, trouble concentrating). I had to come to terms with the reality that the relationship I had with my morning coffee was toxic - I loved it but it didn't love me back 🥲 So I made the switch and this is what I experienced: 

- Weeks 1 and 2 I CRAVED coffee. Matcha just didn't hit the same or give me that BURST of ""let's goooo"" energy that I had become dependent on to will myself into conquering the day
- Week 3 I started to adapt to the change and didn't think about coffee. I also got used to the slow-release caffeine in matcha that provides a more gradual increase in energy 
- Week 4 I had a coffee while traveling and it tasted BAD. I did not enjoy it at all, and not in a ""this is bad coffee"" way but in a ""my tastebuds have reset and I don't like this"" way 
- After that there was no looking back! My coffee cravings were gone, I'd fully come to appreciate the taste, ritual, and feeling of matcha, and I no longer even liked coffee. 

I actually had a coffee a month ago when the coffee shop we frequent was out of matcha and all those old symptoms of shakiness, trouble focusing, and anxiety rushed back 😵‍💫 thus proving to me why I made the switch!

HONEY MATCHA LATTE✨ 
1 tsp matcha powder (I used @piquelife - discount in my bio)
3 oz cold water 
1/2 - 1 tsp honey (I like @manukora manuka honey)
1/3 cup creamy vanilla cashew milk (recipe in my January reels)

To make your latte:
Add the water to a small glass or bowl 
Spoon the matcha powder through a fish mesh sieve to break up any clumps 
Whisk in a front to back motion until slightly frothy on top 
Add the honey and whisk again 
Add ice to your serving glass 
Pour in the milk and top with your honey matcha mixture 
ENJOY!

eEgnbYGED9E,Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte 🍓🍵,"Ingredients:
1 tsp matcha powder
100g (3.5 oz) strawberries 
70ml (1/4 cup) warm water
200ml (7 fl oz) cold milk
ice cubes
sweetener of your choice (optional) 

Instructions:
1. Place the container to froth the milk into the freezer for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small pot, warm the strawberries until they have ""melted."" Strain the mixture through a sieve to get a chunk-free strawberry sauce. Set aside and let cool.
3. Now, fill a tall glass with a handful of ice cubes. In a small bowl or glass, mix 1 tsp matcha powder with 70ml of warm water, stirring until there are no lumps and the mixture is frothy. Pour the Matcha water over the ice cubes. 
4. Add 100ml (3.5 fl oz) of the cold milk to the matcha water. Then, take the container out of the freezer and add the remaining 100ml (3.5 fl oz) of milk to it. Add the strawberry sauce and froth the mixture for 1-2 minutes with an electric milk frother until you like the consistency or it looks like a cloud and the foam has become quite firm. This only works if the container you're frothing in is really ice cold. Pour the strawberry milk foam over the Matcha latte, dust everything with a little bit of Matcha powder, and enjoy your Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte.

Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte: The Viral Fusion You Need to Try
When it comes to beverages, matcha has long held a place in the spotlight. Its earthy, vibrant green flavor paired with its antioxidant-rich benefits has made it a favorite for health enthusiasts and coffee shop lovers alike. But recently, a new star has emerged: the Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte. This refreshing blend combines the timeless elegance of matcha with the nutty, creamy notes of pistachio, creating a delicious and visually stunning drink. But why is pistachio trending, and how did it find its way into our lattes?

Why Pistachio? The Rise of the Viral Nut
Pistachios are having a major moment, and it's not just in lattes. From pistachio-flavored ice cream and desserts to skincare products and fragrances, this nut is everywhere. So, what’s driving the pistachio craze?

Flavor Profile
Pistachios offer a distinct flavor—mildly sweet, nutty, and creamy—which makes them incredibly versatile. They pair well with both savory and sweet dishes, and their delicate taste enhances drinks without overpowering other ingredients. In the context of a cold latte, pistachio adds a richness that complements the grassy tones of matcha, resulting in a drink that's complex yet balanced.

Health Benefits
Just like matcha, pistachios are packed with nutrients. They are rich in healthy fats, protein, fiber, antioxidants, and essential vitamins. The appeal of combining matcha and pistachio lies in their health-boosting properties, creating a beverage that not only tastes great but also supports wellness goals.

Viral Aesthetic Appeal
Let’s face it: people love a visually appealing drink, and the Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte delivers on that front. The blend of matcha’s vibrant green with pistachio’s subtle greenish hue, along with creamy milk and ice, makes for an eye-catching layered aesthetic that’s perfect for Instagram. The drink’s visual appeal has helped drive its popularity, making it a go-to order for those looking to refresh their feeds and their palettes.

Pistachio’s Luxury Image
Pistachios have always been seen as a premium nut, associated with quality and indulgence. Incorporating them into food and beverages adds a touch of luxury and refinement. This trend aligns with the rising interest in “elevated” everyday experiences—people want to turn their daily latte into something more unique and sophisticated, and the pistachio flavor does just that.

How to Make the Perfect Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte at Home
Want to try this trend yourself? Making a Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:

Ingredients:
2 tbsp Salted Pistachio
1/2 tbsp Condense Milk
150ml Milk
Ice
3 tsp Matcha Powder + 50ml hot water

Instructions:

In a small bowl, whisk the matcha powder with a splash of hot water until smooth.
In a glass, add the pistachio paste or syrup and sweetener (if desired). Mix well.
Fill the glass with ice cubes and pour in the milk.
Slowly pour the matcha over the milk and pistachio mixture to create beautiful layers.
Stir gently and enjoy!
Why You Should Give the Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte a Try
Whether you’re a matcha lover, a pistachio enthusiast, or simply looking for the next trendy beverage, the Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte is worth the hype. It offers a sophisticated, balanced flavor profile that’s as satisfying as it is refreshing. Plus, with the added health benefits of both ingredients, it’s a drink you can feel good about.

So, next time you’re in the mood for a cold, creamy pick-me-up, skip the usual and opt for a Matcha Pistachio Cold Latte—your taste buds (and your Instagram feed) will thank you!",swan latte art|leaf latte art|how to learn latte art|homebarista|cusinaverde|youtube shorts|viral youtube shorts|coffee series|how to reduce bloating|cure for bloating|healthy eating habits|tip and tricks in latte art|how to make dalgona coffee|traditional japenese tea|ceremonial green tea|how to latte art Wing Rose|cappuccino|surfing swan latte art|new coffee design|rose latte art|slow pour latte art|can I call you rose|frame tulips|kape|ice cream float,2024-10-19 22:14:03+00:00,38768,417,3,PT11S,2025-10-15 20:44:18.651312+00:00,matcha latte recipe,11.0,0.010833677259595543,360.9376811494445,Short,100

3oOCWWmnn1s,How To Make A Matcha Latte At Home,"Love matcha lattes but don't love the cost? Here's how to make a matcha latte at home and save a few dollars. 

Ingredients: Vegan Matcha Latte
1 ½ cup  (365 g) soy milk (or plant milk of choice)
1 ¼ tsp matcha powder
¾ – 1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tbsp hot water

Method:
Measure out your milk (you can pour the cold milk into your mug of choice if you’d like to make the exact amount you need). Add your milk to a medium pot and heat over medium low heat for 5 minutes or so. Stir frequently.
While your milk warms up, add 1 ¼ teaspoon matcha powder to the bottom of your mug. Add maple syrup and hot tap water and use a matcha whisk or regular whisk to combine. When your matcha no longer has any clumps and looks frothy you’re good to go!
When your milk is warm you will start seeing vapours of steam coming up. You don’t want your milk to boil, otherwise you can get an unpleasant skin of burnt milk on your latte.  
Remove the milk from the heat and use an immersion blender or other frothing device to froth it up, if desired. 
Pour the warm milk into your mug with the matcha mixture. Pour half way and twirl the mug a bit to make sure the two mix well, then top with the remaining milk and foam! Sip away!

Ml86EgbS7O4,How to Make Matcha Latte with Strawberry Cold Foam 🍵🍓 #matcha #latte #recipe,"We LOVE matcha and could literally drink this matcha latte with strawberry cold foam every day! 🧋😋  There’s just something magical about the earthiness of the tea mixed with a splash of freshness from the fruit. 

We prefer this one completely unsweetened, so that’s what we showed in the video. The foam is also not sweet, but you get the essence of the strawberries. Think of it kind of like a La Croix. It’s not sweet, but you still get the flavor of the fruit. If you like your boba drinks sweet, it’s super easy to add a little honey, simple syrup, or whatever else you’d prefer, and it tastes amazing! 🙌

If you give it a try, let us know what you think! And visit our Amazon Store through our bio link to find all the gear we used in this video 👍

INGREDIENTS: 

Matcha Latte:
1 tsp matcha powder
1/4 cup hot water
1tsp honey, or your sweetener of choice (optional)
Milk
Ice
Boba

Cold Foam:
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tbsp milk
1/4 cup strawberry puree

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1️⃣  Pour the matcha and hot water (honey, too, if you want) into a bowl, then mix with an electric milk frother (visit our Amazon shop for the one we use)
2️⃣  Use a food processor or blender to puree the strawberries
3️⃣  Pour the strawberries into a bowl along with the heavy cream and milk, then use the milk frother for about 30 seconds or until it fluffs up (you can also use strawberry syrup or an additional sweetener if you want to make the foam sweet, but we just prefer the more natural essence of the strawberries)
4️⃣  Put some boba into the glass, and then fill the glass up 3/4 of the way with ice.
5️⃣  Pour in the matcha, then fill the rest of the glass with milk (leave about an inch at the top for the foam!!)
6️⃣  Top with foam (optional: sprinkle some matcha powder on top to finish it off)",Matcha|Matcha latte|Cold foam|Strawberry cold foam|Boba|Boba drinks|Matcha recipes|Recipes|Matcha drink recipes|Matcha drinks|Drink recipes,2023-09-12 00:35:38+00:00,19012,668,12,PT22S,2025-10-15 20:44:18.651377+00:00,matcha latte recipe,22.0,0.03576688407321692,764.8393593909375,Short,76

YSpHMUmX_BY,Iced Matcha Latte with Lavender Cold Foam Recipe 🌸,"Make a delicious variation on a healthy matcha latte: a lavender matcha latte with lavender cold foam! 
Matcha is packed with antioxidants to support your brain health, boost your mood, and give you glowing skin! Lavender is a delicious and naturally calming herb that makes the most delicious flavor in your matcha latte 🥰
I colored the lavender cold foam naturally with beet root powder and butterfly pea flower powder, both of which have even more healthy benefits for you
Beet root powder is anti-inflammatory, great for heart health, helps brain function, & gut healthy
Butterfly pea flower is high in antioxidants that lower inflammation, and great for your gut health 

Iced matcha latte ingredients:
1 teaspoon ceremonial grade organic matcha green tea powder
1/4 cup hot water (best water temperature is just below boiling so matcha doesn’t get bitter)
1 tablespoon honey or homemade lavender syrup 
Ice cubes 
1/2-1 cup milk of choice

Directions: 
1. sift matcha into a wide flat mug 
2. Slowly pour your hot water over the matcha whisk into the mug
3. Whisk matcha into the hot water in W motions until starting to get frothy on top 
4. Whisk in the sweetener last 
5. Pour over ice & milk of choice in your cup

For the lavender cold foam: 
1 tablespoon organic heavy cream 
1 tablespoon organic whole milk 
(Dairy free friends can use 1 tablespoon coconut cream and 1 tablespoon flax or soy milk)
1/2 tablespoon homemade lavender syrup 
Pinch butterfly pea powder & beet root powder for purple color 
Directions:
1. Whisk all until a cold foam texture 
2. Pour over your iced matcha latte
Enjoy! 

And homemade lavender syrup is just 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water & 4 lavender tea bags boiled for 10 minutes then cooled off

Hola~

I never thought that my matcha is obsessed with caramel. Honestly this is not a usual caramel, it's caramiso (caramel miso) I know is kinda weird but trust me this caramiso give you umami taste which is good to pairs with matcha. I love this fusion! (earthiness, umaminess, saltiness)

Matcha powder
Hot water

The owner is actually my former guru lol. Because I forgot how to make matcha the right way, he teached me one more time when i visited him! Such a nice person yea?🤣

Matcha 101
  The reason why for matcha latte you don’t need to incorporate air is because, by incorporating air you get that beautiful aroma, but for matcha latte it doesn’t really make that much of a difference (the master said). 
Same for hot matcha latte, because you’re incorporating air into the milk, you don’t need to incorporate air to the matcha. Especially when you’re making latte art, you can’t incorporate air otherwise you’ll have ugly latte art :(

See Part 2 to learn how to whisk matcha like a Pro!! 👇🏻

Fun Facts

Matcha has 3x the antioxidants of regular green tea. It’s practically the superhero of beverages.
The word matcha literally means ""powdered tea"" in Japanese.
Oat milk blends perfectly with matcha’s grassy notes, making it the barista favorite for vegan matcha lattes.
Traditional Japanese tea ceremonies have used matcha since the 12th century!

🌿 Matcha Green Tea Benefits | Why You Should Drink Matcha Daily 🍵✨
Matcha is a nutrient-packed #superfood known for its #antioxidants power, metabolism-boosting properties, and calm energy release.

Its L-theanine content helps enhance focus, reduce stress, and promote mental clarity without the caffeine jitters. Whether you’re looking to boost immunity, improve heart health, or simply get that clean, sustained energy, matcha is your go-to wellness drink. Ideal for #weightloss , gut health, and anti-aging, matcha is a must-have in your daily ritual. 🍃💚

✨Recipe:
1 cup pistachio paste
1 to 1 ½ cup shredded phyllo dough, cut into small pieces
vegetable oil
2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted
¼ cup white chocolate, melted
1 cup flour 
½ cup corn starch
¼ tsp salt
2 tbsp oil
1 ½ cup water

1. In a mold, drizzle white chocolate over and heat baking chocolate (not too hot so it looses it’s temper) as the first layer. Place in the fridge to let that layer set 

Making the Shredded Phyllo Dough (homemade because everywhere is sold out):
1. In a bowl add the flour, cornstarch, salt, oil & water together, whisk until completely smooth. 
2. Strain out all the lumps from the batter and fill a squeeze tube fitted with a super tiny nozzle.
3. Squeeze a small amount of batter out in thin strands until fried. Place aside when they start to pull up.

2. In a pan add the shredded phyllo dough with a small amount of frying oil. Fry until golden brown. Add the pistachio paste and mix together. 
3. Add another layer of melted tempered chocolate overtop of the mold. Set in the fridge until completely harden
4. Pop out of the mold, listen to that ASMR crack and enjoy 😉",littleremyfood|little remy food|little|remy|food|shorts|viral|trend|i tried|the best|comfort food|chocolate|chocolate bar|dubai|dubai chocolate bar|homemade|pistachio,2024-05-31 20:19:10+00:00,9443758,427626,980,PT28S,2025-10-15 20:44:26.001090+00:00,dubai chocolate knafeh,28.0,0.04538511046132271,502.017546308912,Short,31

Pistachio Butter Ingredients:
Unsalted pistachios 300g (there’s a typo in the video)
Milk powder 50g
Powdered sugar 30g
Neutral oil 50 ml
Blue food colour (optional)

Recipe:
- Toast pistachios for 5-10 minutes on low-medium heat.
- Let them cool. Place the pistachios on a kitchen towel and rub them to remove the skin.
- Add toasted pistachios into a blender, blend until it turns into a paste, this takes around 10-15 minutes. 
- Once it comes together, you can add the other ingredients. Add milk powder, powdered sugar and neutral oil (I used sunflower oil). Blend until smooth.
- During the blending process, make sure to take breaks so that the blender doesn’t overheat.
- Optionally, you can add blue food colouring to cancel the yellowness of the pistachios, this gives the butter a greener colour. 
- Pistachio butter is ready! You can store it at room temperature for around 6 months. It lasts even longer if stored in the fridge.",Pistachio butter|pistachio butter recipe|pistachio paste recipe|Dubai chocolate bar from scratch|Dubai chocolate bar|kunafa chocolate|kunafa chocolate recipe|Pistachio spread,2024-10-24 23:30:03+00:00,487217,14422,191,PT1M,2025-10-15 20:44:26.570299+00:00,dubai chocolate knafeh,60.0,0.02999279581787992,355.8849950266088,Longer_Video,95

d3orvFa7Kgw,EP321: Kunafa Chocolate & My Blood Sugar - Dubai Series,"The Sugar Spike Show goes to Dubai! I’ll be testing Middle Eastern classics like hummus, shawarma, and kunafa to see which dishes spike my sugar a lot and which keep it steady.

.
Disclaimer: I’m not a diabetic. Results are different for each person, especially for diabetics & can change from recipe to recipe. My own results vary a little day to day. Ideally, each person should tests on themselves. Glycemic load, calories, quality & quantity of food, all of these matter. Finally, I am not a doctor & this is not medical advice. 
.
How to see my results: Best is to get an idea of which foods spike more and which ones spike less, and develop an intuition based on ingredients. Don’t focus on absolute numbers. 
.
Why I’m doing this if I’m not a diabetic: I’ve noticed that having steady glucose levels makes me feel good & I get lesser food cravings. Plus, prevention is the best medicine. Research today shows that high blood sugar variability over time can lead to diabetes, heart disease & obesity. Please see the work of Dr. Rob Lustig, Dr. Casey Means, Dr. Michael Snyder & Jessie Inchauspé.
.
My personal aim:
1. Blood sugar increase after eating = 30-40mg/dl or lower
2. Return to baseline = Within 3 hours 
3. Range = Be within 70-120mg/dl for 80% of the day",Blood Sugar|continuous glucose monitor|glycemic index|health and fitness,2025-10-11 13:14:52+00:00,86570,1769,33,PT1M28S,2025-10-15 20:44:26.898730+00:00,dubai chocolate knafeh,88.0,0.02081552500866351,4.312209476041667,Longer_Video,55

Kh19B4ZzaN0,Pistachio Knafeh chocolate #dubai #viralchocolate #pistachiochocolate #chocolate #recipes #shorts,"Ingredients:
- 2 bars of milk chocolate, 100g each
- 190g Pistachio Cream
- 100 -150g Frozen Kunafa Dough 
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of white chocolate spread 

Tips to perfect the Pistachio Knafeh Chocolate:-

• The filling mainly includes pistachio cream and toasted knafeh. Incorporate some melted white chocolate or white chocolate spread into this mixture to elevate the flavor.

• For the pistachio cream, I used @pistachino.mena pistachio cream, which includes crunchy pieces of pistachio, along with 2 tablespoons of Choco Lake White Spread

• Toast the knafeh dough in butter until it turns golden brown and crispy.

• Ensure there is a generous amount of filling and keep the chocolate layer thin. More filling enhances the taste.

• Opting for high-quality milk chocolate as the base elevates the chocolate’s quality. I used @lindt Milk Chocolate; feel free to choose any other chocolate of your preference.

• For melting the chocolate, you can use one of three methods:

1. The traditional double boiler method: Melt the milk chocolate by placing it in a heatproof bowl over simmering water, ensuring the chocolate doesn’t come into contact with the water.

2. A quicker method involves melting butter in a pan on the stove, then adding the hot melted butter to the chocolate. Stir continuously, ensuring the chocolate is at room temperature before adding the butter.

3. Alternatively, microwave the chocolate pieces with a small amount of butter for 30 seconds on normal heat settings. Remove from the microwave, stir, and microwave again for 20 seconds or more until the chocolate is melted.

LOC3wVDTKUc,"The viral Dubai chocolate bar ""Can't Get Knafeh of It"" made gluten-free 🤎","This recipe is inspired by the viral Dubai chocolate bar, ‘Can’t Get Knafeh of It’. This luxurious treat combines crispy gluten-free kataifi, pistachio cream, tahini, and a rich chocolate shell. 

NOTES
If you don’t want to make kataifi with sourdough discard or active starter, you can use a 1:1 ratio of gluten-free whole grain flour and water by weight to replace the sourdough starter in the recipe. For example, substitute 240 g of sourdough starter with 120 g of flour and 120 g of water.

I made this recipe using two different silicone molds: a large 20x10x2.5 cm mold and a double mold for two smaller bars measuring 16x8x2.5 cm each. If you use a different size, the ingredient amounts may need to be adjusted.

Makes one 20x10x2.5 cm bar

Gluten-free kataifi (makes about 175 g):
240 g sourdough discard or active starter
65 g tapioca starch
20 g extra-virgin olive oil or neutral oil
40-50 g water 

Pistachio kataifi filling:
140 g gluten-free kataifi
230 g pistachio cream 
23 g tahini

Colour splash:
20 g white chocolate 
matcha powder

Chocolate shell:
200 g high quality chocolate (I used 130 g vegan milk chocolate and 70 g 70% chocolate)

Makes two 16x8x2.5 cm bars

Gluten-free kataifi (makes about 210 g):
295 g sourdough discard or active starter
80 g tapioca starch
25 g extra-virgin olive oil or neutral oil
50-60 g water 

Pistachio kataifi filling:
190 g gluten-free kataifi
320 g pistachio cream 
32 g tahini

Colour splash:
20 g white chocolate 
matcha powder

Chocolate shell:
250 g high quality chocolate (I used 165 g vegan milk chocolate and 85 g 70% chocolate)

Make the gluten-free kataifi:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Add the sourdough discard (or active starter), tapioca starch, and oil to a medium bowl. Gradually add the water, whisking until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. The batter should be thin but not watery. The amount of water needed may vary depending on the gluten-free flours used in the recipe.

3. Transfer the batter into a piping bag and cut off a very small piece from the tip. The hole should be tiny to create thin kataifi. It's important to pipe it very thin to achieve the correct texture in the bar.

4. Gently squeeze the piping bag while making a zig-zag motion from one side of the baking sheet to the other. Immediately bake in the middle of the oven for 4–6 minutes, until completely dry and light golden brown. Some smoke may be produced during baking, so make sure the room is well-ventilated and that you can open a window if necessary. 

5. Transfer the kataifi to a large plate or bowl to cool. The easiest way is to lift the parchment paper carefully off the hot baking sheet and let it slide off.

6. Place the parchment paper back onto the baking sheet and repeat the process with the remaining batter. This recipe makes a little more than what's needed for the Dubai chocolate bar(s). 

Make the Dubai chocolate bar:
1. If you want to decorate the bar with splashes of coloured chocolate, start by melting the white chocolate over a bain-marie. Divide the melted chocolate into two small bowls. To make the green chocolate, add a small amount of matcha powder, gradually adding more until you're happy with the colour. 

2. Use a small spoon to splash the green and white chocolate into the silicone mold. Place into the freezer for at least 10 minutes.

3. Transfer the gluten-free kataifi to a bowl and use your hands to crush it into small pieces. Add the pistachio cream and tahini, and mix together until well combined.

4. Melt the chocolate for the shell over a bain-marie. Remove the silicone mold from the freezer and coat the inside of the mold with a thin layer of chocolate. I find it’s easiest to spoon in the chocolate and use the back of the spoon for even coverage. Work quickly and be careful not to apply too much pressure, so the melted chocolate doesn’t mix with the splashes of coloured chocolate. Place back into the freezer for about 10 minutes, or until the chocolate shell is firm. If the shell looks too thin, repeat this process one more time on top of the first layer of chocolate. I found that about 2–3 mm (0.08-0.12 in) was the perfect thickness.

5. Fill the mold with the kataifi mixture. Spread it evenly into the mold, pressing lightly to ensure it's compact. Pour the remaining chocolate over the filling, spreading it evenly and ensuring the edges are sealed. Tap the mold gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Place back into the freezer for about 10-15 minutes until set. 

6. Once set, carefully remove the bar(s) from the mold and enjoy!

If you’re craving dessert at night, you’ve got to check out this dessert truck in Sydney! 🚚✨

They serve everything about knafeh and here’s what I tried:
🥐 Knafeh Dubai Choc Croissant
🍨 Knafeh with Booza
🔥 Viral Dubai Knafeh
🍓 Strawberry Cup Dubai Choc

You can choose between soft or crispy knafeh 💛 I went with the crispy one for the Dubai Choc Croissant and the warm croissant with the crispy knafeh is such a perfect combo! 🤤

They make the knafeh fresh to order and they’re super generous with the filling and sauce 🍯 Their booza is so fragrant too! 🌸

🗓️ Monday – Sunday
⏰ 5pm – 11pm

Ingredients:
Unsalted butter
Kataifi dough (also known as kunafa dough/shredded phyllo dough)
Chocolate bars
Pistachio cream
Tahini

You will need: A silicon mold

Preparation:
Chop the kataifi dough. Melt butter on medium flame, add the chopped kataifi and toast it for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Then keep it aside to let it cool. Chop the chocolate bars and melt them over a double boiler (dark/semi sweet chocolate can be used but milk chocolate is preferred).

Optional: white chocolate/colored candy melts to drizzle before pouring in the chocolate for decoration.

Now add a layer of melted chocolate on the mold and spread evenly. Titl the mold sideways or upside-down to allow excess chocolate to drip off. Keep it in the freezer until set. Till the chocolate sets in the freezer, add pistachio and tahini to the cooled kataifi and mix until well combined. Then add the pistachio kataifi filling on the chilled chocolate. Add the final layer of chocolate and spread evenly. Keep it in the freezer for 30mins-1 hour until set. Once the chocolate is chilled, carefully detach from the mold and enjoy! Store it in the fridge if you have any leftovers.

Indulge in the richness of Dubai chocolate balls filled with a creamy pistachio surprise! In this recipe video, we'll take you through the step-by-step process of creating these decadent treats that are perfect for special occasions or as a gift for loved ones. From melting the chocolate to piping the pistachio cream, we'll cover it all. Get ready to impress your friends and family with these show-stopping Dubai chocolate balls!

Dubai chocolate balls!

Pistachio cream:
• 150g pistachios (unsalted)
• 1 tbsp powdered sugar
• 80ml milk
• 100g white chocolate
• 100ml milk
• 30g butter
• kadayif
• 100g chocolate + 1 tsp oil

Start by blending shelled, roasted, and unsalted pistachios with one tablespoon of powdered sugar and some milk until you get a smooth, creamy mixture. In a small pot, melt white chocolate with more milk and a knob of butter over low heat, stirring constantly. Once melted, pour the mixture into the pistachio cream and mix well until smooth. Combine the cream with kadayif and mix thoroughly. Let the mixture rest in the fridge until firm — this will make it easier to shape the balls. After forming the balls, dip them in chocolate.
